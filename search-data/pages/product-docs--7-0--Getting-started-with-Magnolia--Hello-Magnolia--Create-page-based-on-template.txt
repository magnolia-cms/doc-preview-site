# Creating a page based on the template

Hello Magnolia

Now you can use the page template to create a page in the Author instance. After you’re done creating, you can publish the page to the Public instance and share it with others to see (but not modify).

1.  Go to the App launcher and click the **Pages** tile to open the Pages app.

2.  Click on **Add page** in the Action bar on the right-hand side.

3.  In the dialog that appears, name your page `hello`. As a template, choose the `hello`, and click **Next**:

4.  In the Page properties dialog, enter `Hello Magnolia` into the Title and Window title fields. Don’t forget to click **Save changes**.

5.  In the Pages app, select the Hello Magnolia page and click **Preview page** on the right to preview it.

6.  Click **Publish**. You can then access the page on the Public instance of your Magnolia installation via the URL
    [http://localhost:8080/magnoliaPublic/hello.html](http://localhost:8080/magnoliaPublic/hello.html).

Congratulations! You’ve created your first Magnolia page built on a page template.

> **Note:** If you don’t see the page published on your public instance, you might have to accept the publication request first in the Magnolia four-eye workflow.

Now, let’s enhance the content of the page by adding an editable custom-built `quotation` component to the area just below the "Hello Magnolia works!" heading.
