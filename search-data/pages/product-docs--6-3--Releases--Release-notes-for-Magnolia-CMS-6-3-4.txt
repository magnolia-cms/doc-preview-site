## [](#_announcements)Announcements

-   [A/B/n Testing module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/ABn-testing/ABn-testing-module/#_changelog) `2.0.1` was released on January 14, 2025.


## [](#_bug_fixes)Bug fixes

-   [MGNLDAM-1596](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-1596) Unicode character can’t be encoded as it’s outside the permitted range

-   [MGNLDAM-1622](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-1622) Bring back image preview and thumbnail in the asset chooser dialog

-   [MGNLUI-9115](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9115) After upgrading to 6.3.x, the Assets app crashes when iterating on a large dataset

    MGNLUI-9115 fixes a critical [known issue](../Release-notes-for-Magnolia-CMS-6.3/Magnolia-6.3-known-issues/#_performance_issues_with_the_assets_app) for customers with large asset datasets. With this bug fix, the .png thumbnails are again rendered using the Imaging module with server-side caching applied (as well as in the browser). As a result of the fix, there is a minor regression in the visual quality of thumbnails with transparency (alpha channel), which will be resolved with [MGNLUI-8938](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-8938).


### [](#_ckeditor_5)CKEditor 5

The Magnolia dialog obscures the CKEditor 5’s dialogs.
