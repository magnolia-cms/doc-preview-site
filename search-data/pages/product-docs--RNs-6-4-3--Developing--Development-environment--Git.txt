# Git

Magnolia source code is version controlled in Git. If you are new to Git or to distributed version control systems in general, read [Git for Eclipse Users](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Git_For_Eclipse_Users) first.

More background and details can be found in the on-line book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Earlier source code is still available via Subversion (SVN) and certain Magnolia files may still contain references to SVN URLs.
