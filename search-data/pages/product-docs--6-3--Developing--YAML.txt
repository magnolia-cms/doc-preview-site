# YAML

This page describes Magnolia’s main uses of [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), a data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages:

-   Using YAML to define items such as templates, dialogs, and apps.

-   Using YAML for exporting and importing JCR content.


## [](#_benefits_of_yaml)Benefits of YAML

YAML is the preferred way to define (configure) templates, dialogs, apps and other definition items in Magnolia.

-   YAML is less difficult to work with in typical development cases such as diffing and merging. A YAML file is basically just a text file.

-   The format is easier to read and edit, the content and overall structure is more readily visible to the user, e.g. importing multi-line quotes and special character needs no escaping.

-   It enables easier creation of JCR import files from other data sources.


To parse YAML data, Magnolia uses [snakeyaml](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml). The data is transformed by the `info.magnolia.map2bean.Map2BeanTransformer`.

| Item | YAML file | Corresponding definition class* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dialog | `myDialog.yaml` | info.magnolia.ui.dialog.DialogDefinition |
| Template | `myTemplate.yaml` | info.magnolia.rendering.template.TemplateDefinition |
| App | `myApp.yaml` | info.magnolia.ui.api.app.AppDescriptor |

## [](#_yaml_for_importing_and_exporting_jcr_content)YAML for importing and exporting JCR content

YAML can also be used to export and import JCR content, which was originally possible only with XML files.

**Example**: An export of a simple page node in YAML format

website.my-page.yaml

```yaml
'my-page':
  'hideInNav': false
  'title': 'This is my page'
  jcr:primaryType: 'mgnl:page'
  jcr:uuid: '701efb1f-c53b-4830-87b5-873776798d80'
  mgnl:created: 2017-05-10T11:40:24.968+07:00
  mgnl:createdBy: 'superuser'
  mgnl:lastModified: 2017-05-10T11:40:34.569+07:00
  mgnl:lastModifiedBy: 'superuser'
  mgnl:template: 'mtk2:pages/basic'
```

## [](#_syntax)Syntax

For a complete reference of the YAML syntax please refer to [http://yaml.org/](http://yaml.org/) or [http://www.yaml.org/refcard.html](http://www.yaml.org/refcard.html). The following syntactic elements are the most widely used though.

-   Whitespace indentation is used to denote structure; however tab characters are never allowed as indentation.

-   Comments begin with the number sign (**`#`**), can start anywhere on a line and continue until the end of the line. Comments must be separated from other tokens by white space characters.

-   Strings (scalars) are ordinarily unquoted, but may be enclosed in double-quotes (`"`), or single-quotes (`'`).


### [](#_sequences)Sequences

Members of a sequence are lines beginning at the same indentation level, and starting with a leading hyphen and at least one space (`-`). The number of spaces after the leading hyphen must be the same for all members in the sequence.

```yaml
# A list of food
- Sandwich
- Pizza
- Burrito
- Chocolate cake
```

### [](#_mappings)Mappings

Mappings (also known as *dictionaries* in YAML, or just *maps* informally) are represented in a simple `key:`` ``value ` form (the colon must be followed by a space):

```yaml
# An employee record
name: John Doe
job: Developer
skill: Beginner
```

### [](#_using_empty_values_in_sequences_and_mappings)Using empty values in sequences and mappings

If you need to set an empty value in a map or sequence, use the empty brackets notation as shown in the following examples:

```yaml
list: []
map: {}
```

A null value used in the way as on line 5 below is reported as a warning with severity level `minor` in the [Definitions app](../../Apps/List-of-apps/Definitions-app/).

```yaml
areas:
  main:
    type: list
    renderType: freemarker
    availableComponents:
```

![Minor error](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-1-yAML-nullValue.png)

### [](#_combinations_of_mappings_and_sequences)Combinations of mappings and sequences

Let’s combine some mappings and sequences, which is a common use case in Magnolia YAML files.

```yaml
---
# An employee record
name: John Doe
job: Developer
skill: Beginner
employed: True
food:
    - Sandwich
    - Pizza
    - Burrito
    - Chocolate cake
drinks: [coke, beer, water, milk] # this is an example of another notation for a sequence
languages:
    groovy: Beginner
    java: Beginner
    freeMarker: Expert
```

> **Note:** The root structure of this file is a mapping.The values of the food and drinks mappings are sequences.The value of the mapping with the key languages is also a mapping.

## [](#_yaml_file_size)YAML file size

[SnakeYAML 1.32](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/src/snakeyaml-1.32/) restricts the size of YAML files to a maximum of approximately `3 MB` to prevent any potential issues with untrusted sources.

> **Caution:** This file limit size could break existing setups if you use any YAML files that are larger than this accepted limit.

> **Tip:** We recommend using XML bootstrap format for bigger exports. They do not have a maximum size limit.

> **Note:** Since Magnolia 6.2.31, exporting such large YAML files is prevented and instead fallbacks to an XML export format.
