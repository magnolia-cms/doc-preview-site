# Infrastructure distribution

Use this page to monitor infrastructure distribution and troubleshoot issues at a glance. This includes information on:

-   **Cloud provider**: The cloud provider used for your infrastructure.

-   **Nodes**: The number of nodes in your infrastructure.

-   **Created**: The date and time the infrastructure was created.

-   **LoadBalancer**: The load balancer used for your infrastructure.


There is also a table of nodes in your infrastructure, showing the node name, status, and other details.
