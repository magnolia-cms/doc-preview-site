# Delete indexes and workloads after restore

When you are performing a restore, you need to delete the workloads before your next deployment. You also need to recreate the indexes folder from your Author environment.

What happens when I delete an index? 🤔

After deleting an index, the system restarts and rebuilds them based on the data found in the [persistence database](../../../cockpit/sections/environments/#_persistence_database).

Downtime varies depending on the amount of data associated with an index. This duration ranges from seconds to hours depending. To help reduce this downtime, we use the [`rollingUpdate` approach](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/).
