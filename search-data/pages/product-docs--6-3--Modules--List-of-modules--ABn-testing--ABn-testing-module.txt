## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.abtesting</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-abtesting</artifactId>
  <version>{magnolia-abtesting-63}</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.abtesting</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-abtesting-ui</artifactId>
  <version>{magnolia-abtesting-63}</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apiGatewayURL` | **required** The API gateway URL provided to you by Magnolia. |
| `authorEventsExcluded` | Default is `true` . Excludes author instance events from the test. |
| `minUniqueVisitors` | **required** The number of minimum unique visitors that must visit the site before results are produced. |
| `minSampleSize` | **required** The minimum overall sample size that must visit the site before results are produced. |
| `maxRemainingDays` | **required** The maximum number of days that can remain in an A/B/n testing campaign. |

## [](#_usage)Usage

When running an A/B/n test using the A/B/n Testing module, a copy of the original page in the `website` workspace is made when the first variant is created.

The original page in the `website` workspace isn’t locked. Only the copy is locked and is used as a base for any variants created.

When a page is being used in a test, the status of the test in displayed in the Pages app. Variants of the original page are not displayed in the Pages app, only the original. If you want to see the variants, you can find them in the [JCR Browser](../../../../Apps/List-of-apps/JCR-Browser-app/).

![JCR browser](../../../../_images/abntest/ab-testing-variants-JCR.png)

Editors can continue working on the original page while the test is running. When the test completes and users must decide which variant to use, they’re warned that the original has changed since the test began.

> **Warning:** Segments are not locked nor copied when used in a test. The effect of deleting or modifying a segment that is actively being used in a test is not defined. We recommend you create dedicated segments for each test.

For more information, see the [A/B/n Testing app](../ABn-testing-app/) page.

### [](#_abn_testing_for_multilanguage_websites)A/B/n Testing for multilanguage websites

In the context of a multilanguage website, the A/B/n Testing feature behaves differently depending on the multilanguage structure configured:

-   When using a [single tree structure](../../../../Administration/Language/Multilanguage-structure/#_single_tree), the multilanguage content is stored in a single JCR content node. This means that you must create one A/B/n Testing test that covers all the languages.

    For example, if your website is in German and French, one test covers both languages.

-   When using a [multiple tree structure](../../../../Administration/Language/Multilanguage-structure/#_multiple_trees), the multilanguage structure consists of separate website trees. In this case, you must create an A/B/n Testing test for each language that you want to test.

    For example, if you want to run the same test for German and French, you must create two A/B/n Testing tests: one for each language.


> **Note:** The A/B/n Testing feature doesn’t work with the URL Translation incubator module.

## [](#_uninstalling)Uninstalling

To uninstall the A/B/n Testing module:

1.  Go to the A/B/n Testing app, abort any running tests and delete all tests.

2.  In your site definition, revert any changes you made when [Enabling CORS for the POST method](#_enabling_cors_for_the_post_method).

3.  Go to the Configuration app and delete the following nodes:

    -   `/modules/cache/config/contentCaching/defaultPageCache/cachePolicy/shouldBypassVoters/deny/abTestingPage`

    -   `/server/filters/cms/testingResolver`

    -   `/server/filters/sitemesh/decoratedFilter/contentProcessor/tagRuleBundles/magnolia/rules/DisableLinksInABVariantEditor`


4.  Shut down Magnolia, remove the A/B/n Testing module JAR files (`magnolia-abtesting.jar`, `magnolia-abtesting-ui.jar`) from `WEB-INF/lib` and start up Magnolia again.


> **Note:** If you don’t use the Analytics module outside of A/B/n Testing purposes, delete the magnolia-analytics-x JAR files too.
