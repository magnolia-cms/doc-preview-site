# In-app Search

In-app Search lets you focus your search within a specific Magnolia app, such as Assets or Pages, making it easier to find content in large collections. It searches text fields like Name or Title and works seamlessly with app-specific filters to deliver precise results. Search is also available in chooser dialogs for apps using JCR-based data sources.

## [](#_key_features)Key features

-   **Targeted search**: Search within a single app’s content, focusing on fields like Name or Title.

-   **Flat list view**: Results are displayed in a clear, flat list for easy browsing.

-   **Chooser dialog search**: Search within dialogs (for example, Asset chooser) for quick content selection.
