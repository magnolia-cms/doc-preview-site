# Logging and monitoring

## [](#_overview)Overview

All subpages in this section emphasize monitoring and logging activities, as well as the use of headers and logger entries for troubleshooting and data capture.

Tuning tips - Logging and monitoring

-   **Loggers**

    -   Adjusting your App Launcher layout configuration and removing any unused apps can help optimize performance.

    -   Track issues by adding logger entries for classes or packages depending on the scope of the issue.

        For more, see [Loggers](Monitoring/#_loggers).


-   **Log Tools app**

    -   View and download log files conveniently.

    -   Remember that logging changes made in the Log Tools app only stay in effect until Magnolia is shut down. To permanently change your logging configuration, you must modify the `log4j2.xml` file.

        For more, see [Log Tools app](Log-tools-app/).


-   **JMX monitoring**

    -   Use MBeans, added in Magnolia 6.3, to optimize your custom code.

    -   You can use Tools like JConsole to visually represent performance and resource consumption.

        For more, see [JMX Monitoring](JMX-monitoring/).
