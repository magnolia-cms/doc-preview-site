# Commerce integration framework

Commerce Unbundled: [Framework](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/#_module_types) [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible License: [DX Core](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/License/#_dx_core){frameworks-and-extensions-license-note}

The CMS functionality of a specialized e-commerce platform is often limited and costly to extend.

With the Commerce integration framework, you connect your e-commerce solution to Magnolia CMS to fulfill your needs with powerful templating while retaining the strong cataloging features offered by your e-commerce solution.

Magnolia also communicates shopping cart and order information with your e-commerce solution over a REST API.

Magnolia provides out-of-the-box connectors to the following third-party solutions:

-   Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento)

-   commercetools Commerce Platform

-   Salesforce Commerce Cloud (certified connector)

-   SAP Commerce Cloud (certified connector, formerly Hybris)

## [](#_licensing)Licensing

The **Commerce integration framework** is included with your [DX Core license](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/License/) and is free of charge. However, the associated extensions are paid and require an additional special license.

## [](#_integrate_and_view_your_e_commerce_content)Integrate and view your e-commerce content

The Commerce integration framework enables you to pull your catalogs of products and categories from your existing e-commerce solution into Magnolia with minimal configuration required. You can then use the out-of-the-box templating function to create templates and render your e-commerce content on your website.

The Commerce integration framework provides an [E-commerce app](ecommerce-app/) so that editors and marketers can display the content retrieved.

> **Tip:** Catalogs, categories and their products are searchable in Magnolia using the Find bar. You can also enable Magnolia’s AI-powered image recognition and text classification features to improve findability.

## [](#_choose_and_use_your_e_commerce_content_in_magnolia)Choose and use your e-commerce content in Magnolia

Marketers can use out-of-the box [page template and components](ecommerce-app/#_using_your_e_commerce_content) provided in the Magnolia Pages app to get started.

A user-friendly product and category chooser lets you [pick content](ecommerce-app/#_adding_e_commerce_content_to_a_page) from your third party e-commerce solution directly in the Magnolia interface.

> **Tip:** Catalogs, categories and their products are searchable in Magnolia using the Find Bar.

## [](#_rest_api_shopping_cart_feature)REST API shopping cart feature

Magnolia acts as a bridge between the cart feature on your e-commerce website and the integrated e-commerce solution.

When a customer adds a product to their cart online or proceeds to checkout, Magnolia communicates that information to your source e-commerce platform so that your stock is updated, orders sent and so on.

Magnolia manages both guest carts and authenticated carts. We provide a full [REST API](ecommerce-rest-endpoints/) to handle interaction between the cart, Magnolia and your e-commerce solution.

> **Tip:** The REST API also allows you to get data on products and categories, making it suitable for headless implementations.
