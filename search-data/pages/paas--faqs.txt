## [](#_content_delivery_and_site_access)Content delivery and site access

### [](#_how_do_i_cache_urls_with_parameters)How do I cache URLs with parameters?

Expand for answer

By default, Magnolia does not cache URLs with parameters, unlike Fastly, which caches them automatically. If you inspect the response headers, you may see a `Cache-Control` directive like:

```sh
no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0, private (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | This indicates that Magnolia is instructing browsers and proxies not to cache the page. |

To allow Magnolia to cache product URLs with query parameters, you need to whitelist the parameters explicitly. You can do this by modifying Magnolia’s cache configuration.

Follow these steps:

1.  Locate your cache configuration file.

    This is usually under `cache/configuration/contentCaching/defaultPageCache/cachePolicy/shouldBypassVoters/deny/parameters/whitelist` in your Magnolia instance.

2.  Whitelist the necessary parameters. You must specify which URL parameters should be considered cacheable.

    Example configuration

    ```yaml
    cache:
      config:
        contentCaching:
          defaultPageCache:
            cachePolicy:
              shouldBypassVoters:
                deny:
                  parameters:
                    whitelist:
                      productId: ^\d+$ (1)
                      category: ^\w+$ (2)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Example that allows caching for `productId` parameters that are numeric. |
    | **2** | Example that allows caching for `category` parameters that are alphanumeric.<br><br>Verifying changes<br><br>Once the configuration is updated, check the response headers for your product URL. You should see `Cache-Control` directives indicating that the content is now cacheable. |


For more, see [Whitelisting specific parameters](../configuration/cache/#_whitelisting_specific_parameters).

### [](#_is_there_a_way_to_manage_site_traffic_spikes)Is there a way to manage site traffic spikes?

Expand for answer

Yes. With our premium **Fastly Waiting Room** feature.

For more, see [Waiting room](../cockpit/sections/content-delivery/#_fastly_waiting_room).

### [](#_how_do_i_deliver_personalized_content_with_cdn_caching)How do I deliver personalized content with CDN caching?

Expand for answer

If you’re using Magnolia’s personalization features (traits and variants), CDN caching requires special configuration. Without this configuration, all users see the same cached version of personalized pages regardless of their traits.

The CDN must be configured to:

-   Extract and normalize trait information from requests

-   Create separate cache entries for different trait categories

-   Maintain good cache performance by limiting the number of trait variations


For full details, see [Personalize content with CDN caching](../configuration/cache/personalization-with-cdn-cache/).

### [](#_can_i_cache_backend_responses)Can I cache backend responses?

Expand for answer

Yes, you can cache responses from the backend server with some slight tweaks to your Magnolia configuration.

For more on how to do this, see the article [here](../configuration/cache/cache-backend-responses/).

### [](#_do_i_need_extra_configuration_for_cdn_caching)Do I need extra configuration for CDN caching?

Expand for answer

Only if you are using a headless approach with a frontend server, in this case, you will have to make sure you set the `Cache-Control` headers with the values you want the CDN to use.

### [](#_can_i_customize_the_cdn_cache_configuration)Can I customize the CDN cache configuration?

Expand for answer

For setups that aren’t exclusively headless, yes.

For more on this, see [here](../configuration/cache/).

### [](#_can_i_add_additional_headers_to_the_cdn)Can I add additional headers to the CDN?

Expand for answer

Yes. However, this is done with an incubator module.

For more on this, see [here](../../cdn-helper/).

### [](#_are_404_errors_cached_can_i_exclude_them)Are `404` errors cached? Can I exclude them?

Expand for answer

Yes the following are cached by default.

-   `200 OK`

-   `203 Non-Authoritative Information`

-   `300 Multiple Choices`

-   `301 Moved Permanently`

-   `302 Moved Temporarily`

-   `404 Not Found`

-   `410 Gone`


You can exclude `404` errors. If you want to do this, please contact the [HELPDESK](mailto:https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/13).

> **Caution:** Doing this could allow bots to hammer your site with requests. By not caching 404 errors, there will be more requests to your backend.

### [](#_is_the_cdn_cache_flushed_automatically_after_publishing)Is the CDN cache flushed automatically after publishing?

Expand for answer

Option 1 You can manually purge the CDN in the Cockpit.

For more details, see the [Purge CDN](../cockpit/sections/content-delivery/#_cdn_statistics) section.

By default, CSS, JavaScript, and images are cached. Pages are not cached by default. However, you can configure your policy to cache Pages.

See [Server cache policy](../configuration/cache/#_server_cache_policy) for help with that.

Option 2 You can configure a REST Client to trigger CDN cache flushing.

For more details, see [Automate flushing of CDN cache](../configuration/cache/automate-cdn-cache-flush/).

## [](#_development)Development

### [](#_does_dx_cloud_support_jcr_clustering)Does DX Cloud support JCR clustering?

Expand for answer

DX Cloud does not support JCR clustering. This is primarily for performance reasons.

### [](#_can_i_deploy_a_frontend_with_paas)Can I deploy a frontend with PaaS?

Expand for answer

Yes, you can. You can deploy as many frontend applications as you need. In fact, we have a few frontend templates to get you started.

Check them out [here](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/developers-artifact/frontend-templates).

### [](#_i_cant_create_a_password_in_the_passwords_app_what_do_i_do)I can’t create a password in the Passwords App. What do I do?

Expand for answer

If you are upgrading [Helm](#_how_do_i_update_the_helm_chart_version) to version `1.14` or later and running Magnolia `6.2.44`+, you must manually move the password manager keypair properties file to the expected location for the DX Cloud Helm chart.

For instructions on how to do this, see [Setup: Password manager key](../setup/#_password_manager_key).

### [](#_why_dont_i_see_thumbnail_previews_for_my_assets)Why don’t I see thumbnail previews for my assets?

Expand for answer

By default, thumbnails are disabled to ensure optimal performance in DX Cloud. Projects with a large volume of assets per folder can cause serious performance issues when thumbsnails are enabled. If you wish to turn thumbnails back on, you can do so by setting `thumbnails: true` in the [`dam.subApps.yaml` file](../../dam-app/developers/dam-app-jcr/#_turning_image_thumbnails_off_in_the_asset_browser).

For more details, see [Storing assets](../best-practices/storing-assets/).

### [](#_how_do_i_handle_redirects)How do I handle redirects?

Expand for answer

To use redirects in DX Cloud, create them directly via the Cockpit if you are dealing with larger numbers of redirects. If you only have a few redirects (e.g. fewer than 10), you can manage them directly in a redirects ingress.

> **Note:** We recommend you use the Cockpit redirects option, especially if you have greater than 10 redirects.

### [](#_can_i_have_a_dedicated_custom_error_page_per_site)Can I have a dedicated custom error page per site?

Expand for answer

Yes, you can have a dedicated custom error page per site by using Virtual URI mapping. However, you should always proceed with extra caution when using Virtual URI mapping.

For more details, see [Virtual URI mapping](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/URI-mapping/Virtual-URI-mapping/).

1.  In your configuration at `server/filters/cms/bypasses/`, remove the **docroot** bypass.

2.  In your configuration at `server/webContainerResources/mappings/`, change `/docroot/` **to `/modules/`**.

    ![faq virtualUri mapping valueChange](../_images/faq-virtualUri-mapping-valueChange.jpg)

3.  Now, configure your Virtual URI mapping.

    Example configuration

    ```yaml
    class: info.magnolia.virtualuri.mapping.DefaultVirtualUriMapping
    fromUri: /docroot/404.html (1)
    toUri: forward:/404.html (2)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Routes from the root `404` page (which happens by default). |
    | **2** | Routes to the `404` page found in the site tree. |


### [](#_sso_on_dx_cloud_isnt_working_what_do_i_do)SSO on DX Cloud isn’t working. What do I do?

Expand for answer

If [SSO in DX Cloud](../sso/) is failing due to incorrect protocol inference, setting the port to `https` in the Helm chart ensures Magnolia will generate redirect URLs using HTTPS.

Example

```yaml
  - host: {{ .Env.DEPLOYMENT }}.author.paastraining.magnolia-platform.io
    paths:
    - path: /
      instance: author
      port: https (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | To do this, ideally, you should be using Helm `{helm-chart-version}` or `{helm-chart-version-1}`. |

## [](#_domains_and_certificates)Domains and Certificates

### [](#_do_ssl_certificates_have_to_be_configured_on_fastly_and_kubernetes)Do SSL certificates have to be configured on Fastly and Kubernetes?

Expand for answer

Yes.

However, this is done automatically.

You just need to [add the certificate](../cockpit/sections/networking/#_manage_certificates) via the Cockpit.

Once the certificate is ready and the Fastly annotation has been correctly applied, the certificate is automatically sent and configured in Fastly.

> **Important:** You must manage renewing any custom certificates.

### [](#_where_do_i_point_a_records_to)Where do I point `A` records to?

Expand for answer

If you need to map a domain using an `A` record, point the domain to the IPs associated with the load balance servers.

You can retrieve this with the following command:

Command

```sh
dig https://adb8bffe76c8c422087e3732eabd17b9-58b5e8e7a952af5b.elb.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The load balancer domain. |

Response

```sh
https://adb8bffe76c8c422087e3732eabd17b9-58b5e8e7a952af5b.elb.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com  300  IN  A  203.0.113.1 (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The IP address associated with the domain. This is the IP address you should use for your `A` record. |

### [](#_can_i_use_a_wildcard_when_adding_a_certificate)Can I use a wildcard when adding a certificate?

Expand for answer

Yes, you can use wildcards for custom certificates, which are handled in the [Cockpit](../cockpit/sections/networking/#_manage_certificates).

However, if using LetsEncrypt, you must file a [Support request](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/13) for wildcard certificates as of 2026-02-18.

## [](#_general)General

### [](#_are_dx_cloud_users_automatically_logged_out_after_a_period_of_inactivity)Are DX Cloud users automatically logged out after a period of inactivity?

Expand for answer

Yes. After **15** minutes of inactivity, the user is automatically logged out of the Cockpit.

### [](#_can_you_send_emails_with_dx_cloud)Can you send emails with DX Cloud?

Expand for answer

In short, no. This is not currently in scope for DX Cloud.

At the moment, we recommend that you use some of the available external services such as Mailgun, Mailchimp, etc.

The above statement is not an endorsement of any particular service, but is solely intended to provide a starting point for your mail service search.

### [](#_how_many_authors_can_work_in_magnolia_on_dx_cloud)How many authors can work in Magnolia on DX Cloud?

Expand for answer

There is technically no exact maximum to the number of concurrent authors that can be working on Magnolia on DX Cloud.

However, we recommend that no more than **50** authors work in Admincentral concurrently. This helps avoid latency issues in Admincentral due to too many authors using the Pages app, too many authors publishing, or just generally too many actions occurring simultaneously.

## [](#_helm)Helm

### [](#_how_do_i_find_the_latest_helm_chart_version)How do I find the latest Helm chart version?

Expand for answer

The latest helm chart version is `{helm-chart-version}`.

> **Tip:** Check out the Magnolia helm repo for more details.

### [](#_do_i_need_to_use_the_latest_helm_chart_version)Do I need to use the latest Helm chart version?

Expand for answer

As of Magnolia 6.2.59, the latest Helm chart is required for compatibility and optimal performance. We strongly recommend always deploying the latest Helm chart to leverage enhanced stability, security updates, and streamlined configuration management.

For detailed guidance on Helm charts and the `values.yml` file, refer to [Helm values](../deployment/helm-values/).

### [](#_what_is_the_minimum_helm_chart_version_needed_for_magnolia_6_3)What is the minimum Helm chart version needed for Magnolia 6.3?

Expand for answer

The minimum Helm chart version needed for Magnolia 6.3 is `1.15.0`. However, we strongly recommend you upgrade to the latest Helm chart version chart where possible to ensure compatibility and the latest features.

You upgrade your version in the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file.

```yaml
...
helm upgrade prod mironet magnolia-helm --version {helm-chart-version} -f values_new.yml -n prod
...
```

The latest helm chart version is `{helm-chart-version}`.

> **Tip:** Check out the Magnolia helm repo for more details.

For more on Magnolia 6.3, see [Magnolia 6.3](../../product-docs/6.3/).

### [](#_how_do_i_update_the_helm_chart_version)How do I update the Helm chart version?

Expand for answer

You update the Helm chart version in the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file. You must modify the version, the values file, and the namespace. Pipeline configuration may vary by customer implementation; though we do provide blueprints. Ensure you adapt the configuration accordingly to fit the project requirements.

-   Global variable

-   Command line


Specify the desired Helm chart version here. This shows the latest version.

`gitlab.ci.yaml` file

```yaml
variables:
  HELM_CHART_VERSION: {helm-chart-version}
```

```yaml
...
helm upgrade prod mironet magnolia-helm --version {helm-chart-version} -f values_new.yml -n prod
...
```

## [](#_ingresses)Ingresses

### [](#_how_do_synchronization_and_claiming_work_for_ingresses)How do synchronization and claiming work for Ingresses?

Expand for answer

**Synchronization**

-   Updates the Cockpit view of an **unclaimed ingress** to match its current configuration in the Kubernetes cluster (for example, managed via Rancher).

-   Lets you review the ingress state in the Cockpit before deciding to claim it for Cockpit management.

-   Available only for **unclaimed ingresses**.

-   Ingresses created in the Cockpit are typically claimed and aligned with Kubernetes on publish. Synchronization is mainly needed if there are external changes or validation issues.


**Claiming**

-   When you claim an ingress, the Cockpit takes exclusive control of it.

-   After claiming, synchronization is disabled because the Cockpit manages the ingress configuration exclusively.

-   External changes to a claimed ingress (for example, via Rancher) are not reflected in the Cockpit and will be overwritten by any Cockpit publish.

-   To avoid conflicts, manage claimed ingresses exclusively through the Cockpit.


In short, synchronize to review the latest state of an unclaimed ingress, then claim it to manage it in the Cockpit. Once claimed, synchronization stops.

See [Synchronize an ingress](../cockpit/sections/networking/#_synchronize_an_ingress) for details.

### [](#_how_do_i_set_fastly_as_my_cdn_provider_for_an_ingress)How do I set Fastly as my CDN provider for an ingress?

Expand for answer

To set your CDN provider to Fastly in the ingress:

1.  First, [Connect to Fastly](../configuration/cache/connect-to-fastly/).

2.  Then, set `magnolia.info/cdn-provider` to `fastly`.

    ```yaml
    magnolia.info/cdn-provider: fastly (1)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | In this example, `fastly` is set as the CDN provider. |


With this setup, you’ll be able to whitelist the IPs necessary for Fastly to retrieve pages from the ingress.

For more on whitelisting, see [Secure ingresses](../security/basicauth_whitelisting/).

### [](#_is_it_okay_to_use_ingress_nginx_snippets)Is it okay to use `ingress-nginx` snippets?

Expand for answer

Generally, no. You should only use configuration and/or server snippets exactly as instructed by documentation or the DX Cloud team. Making changes to these snippets without consultation or approval could lead to unintended consequences for your PaaS project.

### [](#_i_want_to_add_snippets_for_redirect_rules_is_this_okay)I want to add snippets for redirect rules. Is this okay?

Expand for answer

No. As stated in [Is it okay to use `ingress-nginx` snippets?](#_is_it_okay_to_use_ingress_nginx_snippets), we generally advise against using nginx-ingress configuration and server snippets and you should only use it exactly as instructed by the documentation or the DX Cloud team.

For redirects, use our [Redirects](../cockpit/sections/networking/#_create_redirects) feature in the Cockpit.

## [](#_licenses)Licenses

### [](#_how_do_i_add_my_magnolia_license_for_dx_cloud)How do I add my Magnolia license for DX Cloud?

Expand for answer

For DX Cloud, you bootstrap your license in your project [`values.yml` file](../deployment/helm-values/#env) provided to you at the start of your project.

```yaml
  magnoliaAuthor:
    ...
    env:
      ...
      - name: magnolia.bootstrap.license.owner
        value: "[replace with email]"
      - name: magnolia.bootstrap.license.key
        value: "[replace with key]"
```

> **Important:** The license gets injected only when an environment gets created via the Helm chart, meaning this only happens once, when the environment is created.If you need to update your license, it should be handled directly in Magnolia.

### [](#_how_do_i_update_my_magnolia_license_key)How do I update my Magnolia license key?

Expand for answer

Your license key is entered in the `values.yml` file during onboarding for DX Cloud, so you don’t need to worry about entering it to get started.

However, you may need to update your license at some point. For example, when your license expires, you need to update to a license that isn’t expired. In this case, you should update your license key directly within Magnolia instead of the `values.yml` file.

For steps on how to do this, see [Updating a license key](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/License/#_updating_a_license_key).

## [](#_managing_paas)Managing PaaS

### [](#_what_is_a_sticky_session)What is a sticky session?

Expand for answer

Sticky sessions, or session persistence, is when you instruct the load balancer to remain linked to a specific node (*server*) to avoid losing the session data if the request goes to the other server. Essentially, you send the request from a given IP to the delivery server, but continue to send follow-up requests to the **same** server until the session expires. Session persistence is needed when the project has transactions or required data in the session.

Sticky sessions are typically used in situations where you have some data in the session and the sessions are not replicated between servers, but you also need to ensure that the data doesn’t get lost.

### [](#_how_do_i_configure_sticky_sessions)How do I configure sticky sessions?

Expand for answer

To enable sticky sessions:

1.  Go to your `values.yml` file in your DX Cloud project.

2.  Set the following ingress annotations:

    ```yaml
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 512m
        cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod-dns"
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: "cookie" (1)
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity-mode: "persistent" (2)
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: "INGRESSCOOKIE" (3)
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-max-age: "3600" (4)
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/default-backend: {{ .Env.DEPLOYMENT }}-magnolia-error-page-svc
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/custom-http-errors: "503"
      hosts:
        - host: {{ .Env.DEPLOYMENT }}.eu-playground.magnolia-platform.com
          paths:
              - path: /
                instance: public
              - path: /author
                instance: author
    ...
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Set `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity` to `cookie`. |
    | **2** | Set `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity-mode` to `persistent`. |
    | **3** | Put the `INGRESSCOOKIE` at `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name`. If you use a [Cookie based redirect server](../cockpit/sections/networking/#_add_redirect_server), the name **must not** be the same as the value in the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name` ingress annotation in your `values.yml` file. |
    | **4** | Set `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-max-age` to the time (*in seconds*) you want the cookie to persist. After this configured time, the cookie is deleted. |


### [](#_how_do_i_define_custom_environment_variables)How do I define custom environment variables?

Expand for answer

You can define custom environment variables in the Helm Values file in your project.

To define a variable for the OS

Define the name and value of the variable like so:

```yaml
...
magnoliaAuthor:
  env:
    - name: VARIABLE
      value: "VALUE"
...
```

To define a variable for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Set the value for the specified object like so:

```yaml
...
magnoliaAuthor:
  catalinaExtraEnv:
    variable: "VALUE"
...
```

### [](#_can_i_delete_environment_indexes)Can I delete environment indexes?

Expand for answer

Yes you can.

-   Cockpit

-   k8s


To delete the index folders:

1.  Go to **Environments > Manage**.

2.  Click **Delete indexes** for the desired environment.


To delete the index folders:

1.  In Rancher, click on the **Execute shell** navigation item on the desired Author environment.

    ![rancher execute shell screenshot](../_images/kubernetes/rancher-execute-shell-screenshot.jpg)

2.  Run the following commands:

    ```sh
    cd /mgnl-home/repositories/magnolia/workspaces/ (1)
    find . -name index -exec rm -rf {} \; (2)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Changes to your `workspaces` directory. |
    | **2** | Finds and removes the index folders. |


### [](#_what_is_the_fastly_maintenance_page)What is the Fastly maintenance page?

Expand for answer

The Fastly maintenance page is at the CDN level. To use this approach, reach out to the [Helpdesk](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/13) for assistance.

### [](#_how_i_regenerate_a_new_activation_key_pair)How I regenerate a new activation key pair?

Expand for answer

The re-creation of the key pair must be done on the author instance.

1.  Go to AdminCentral.

2.  Open the **Publishing Tools** app.

    ![click publishing tools app](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/_images/admincentral/administration/click-publishing-tools-app.jpg)

3.  Click on **Generate new key**.

    ![publishing tools app click generate new key](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/_images/admincentral/administration/publishing-tools-app_click-generate-new-key.jpg)

    The system creates both keys and stores them in the `magnolia-activation-keypair.properties` file. In addition, the system stores the public key in the author system’s JCR.


When using DX Cloud, the keys are automatically distributed to the public instance with the help of a dedicated [sidecar](../architecture/#_kubernetes_and_sidecars).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image.tomcat.tag` | `string` | `"10.1-jre17-temurin"` | Tomcat repo tag. • For Magnolia 6.4 and later, you should use at least `10.1-jre17-temurin` . • For Magnolia 6.3 and earlier, you should use `9.0-jre11-temurin"` . |

| Permission | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Requests within PaaS all require a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) which is only available to the Magnolia Bootstrap sidecar. |
