# Content Translation app

The app is installed by the [Content Translation Support module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Translation-Support-module/).

The Content Translation app allows you to manually export and re-import page content in translation-friendly [XLIFF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xliff), CSV and Excel formats. You can then send it to your translation office and import the translated content back. The generated output file includes context information and a link back to the page to facilitate translation.
