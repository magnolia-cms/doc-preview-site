# Slug field

info.magnolia.editor.field.SlugFieldDefinition is a special type of [text field](../../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Text-field/) provided by the [Content Editor module](../). It creates an editable text field that allows you to adjust the URL of a Content Editor story to a more human-readable form, for example from

`example.com/stories/flying-grand-canyon-and-southwest.html`

to

`example.com/stories/fly-grand-canyon`

The same can be achieved with [URI mapping](../../../../Administration/URI-mapping/), which is a more generic solution. For more details, see the section [A user-friendly path vs full path](../../../../Administration/URI-mapping/#_a_user_friendly_path_vs_full_path).

> **Note:** The slug field can only be used in the context of the Content Editor module.

## [](#_example_definition)Example definition

(Excerpted from the [Stories app](../../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Stories-app/) configuration.)

/stories-app/apps/stories.yaml

```yml
datesAndUrl:
...
  properties:
...
    jcrName:
      $type: slugField
      label: URL slug
      placeholder: Add URL slug...
```

Since the field extends `TextFieldDefinition`, you can use the [text field properties](../../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Text-field/#_field_properties) to configure the field.
