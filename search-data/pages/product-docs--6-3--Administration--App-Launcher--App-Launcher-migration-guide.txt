# Migrating to the 6.3 App Launcher design

The Magnolia 6.3 [App Launcher](../../../Authoring/App-Launcher/) uses a modern naming and groupings. The original Magnolia 6.2 **classic naming and grouping** is no longer available in Magnolia 6.3.

If you used a custom configuration of the App Launcher in Magnolia 6.2, you must migrate your definition for the 6.3 App Launcher.

## [](#_migration_notes)Migration notes

-   In Magnolia 6.3, the `layout` property defines [the grouping and layout of the App launcher](../App-launcher-layout/).

-   The respective YAML syntax differs from the [compatibilityLayout](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Administration/App-Launcher/Compatibility-app-launcher-layout.adoc) property, which is no longer available in Magnolia `6.3`.

-   Migration is possible for on-premise Magnolia installations or PaaS (Platform as a Service) subscriptions that still use the `compatibilityLayout` property.


## [](#_definition_changes)Definition changes

This section compares definitions for the `compatibilityLayout` property and the `layout` property. The `compatibilityLayout` property retrieves which apps are in which groups from the `appLauncherLayout` property.

### [](#_moving_an_app_from_one_group_to_another)Moving an app from one group to another

-   JCR before 6.2.22

-   `compatibilityLayout` for 6.2.22 or later

-   `layout` decoration for 6.2.26 or later


To move apps between groups, you must move the respective app(s) in JCR.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Node name | Value |
| ⸬ appLauncherLayout |     |
| ⸬ groups |     |
| ⸬ <GROUP\_NAME> |     |
| ⸬ apps |     |
| ⸬ <APP\_NAME> |     |

An `apps` property can’t be added under the `compatibilityLayout` property in the YAML definition. To move apps between groups, you must move the respective app(s) in JCR.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Node name | Value |
| ⸬ appLauncherLayout |     |
| ⸬ groups |     |
| ⸬ <GROUP\_NAME> |     |
| ⸬ apps |     |
| ⸬ <APP\_NAME> |     |

Apps are listed for each group under the group name.

/<LIGHT\_MODULE>/decorations/admincentral/config.yaml

```yaml
layout:
  groups:
    - name: <GROUP_NAME>
      apps:
      - name: <APP_NAME>
```

### [](#_hiding_apps)Hiding apps

-   JCR before 6.2.22

-   `compatibilityLayout` for 6.2.22 or later

-   `layout` decoration for 6.2.26 or later


You must add the respective app(s) under the `hiddenApps` node in JCR to hide apps.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Node name | Value |
| ⸬ appLauncherLayout |     |
| ⸬ hiddenApps |     |
| ⬩ <APP\_NAME> | <APP\_NAME> |

A `hiddenApps` property can’t be added under the `compatibilityLayout` property in the YAML definition. You must add the respective app(s) under the `hiddenApps` property in JCR to hide apps.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Node name | Value |
| ⸬ appLauncherLayout |     |
| ⸬ hiddenApps |     |
| ⬩ <APP\_NAME> | <APP\_NAME> |

Add apps in the format below under the `hiddenApps` property.

/<LIGHT\_MODULE>/decorations/admincentral/config.yaml

```yaml
layout:
  hiddenApps:
    <APP_NAME>: <APP_NAME>
```

### [](#_removing_a_row_from_the_layout)Removing a row from the layout

-   JCR before 6.2.22

-   `compatibilityLayout` for 6.2.22 or later

-   `layout` decoration for 6.2.26 or later


There was no `rows` property before 6.2.22. To remove a row, you must delete the `<GROUP_NAME>` content node and its subnodes.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Node name | Value |
| ⸬ appLauncherLayout |     |
| ⸬ groups |     |
| ⸬ <GROUP\_NAME> |     |

There is one `rows` property under which each `groups` property represents a row in the App Launcher layout.

/admincentral/config.yaml

```yaml
compatibilityLayout:
  rows:
    - groups: (1)
        - edit
        - target
      cssClass: editor
    - groups: (2)
        - manage
      cssClass: editor
    - groups: (3)
        - tools
        - dev
        - stk
      cssClass: developer
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The first row in the App Launcher layout contains two groups. |
| **2** | The second row in the App Launcher layout contains one group. |
| **3** | The third row in the App Launcher layout contains three groups. |

The first example shows part of the `config.yaml`, which you can inspect in the **Resource Files** app. The second example shows you how to decorate so that a row is not displayed.

/admincentral/config.yaml

```yaml
layout:
  groups:
    - name: content
      apps:
        - name: pages-app
        - name: dam
        - name: stories
        - name: tours
        - name: contacts
- ...
  rows:
    - name: one
      cssClass: editor
      groups:
        content: content
        marketing: marketing
  ...
```

/<LIGHT\_MODULE>/decorations/admincentral/config.yaml

```yaml
layout:
  rows:
    - name: one
      displayed: false (1)
  ...
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Add the `displayed` property to your decoration and set it to `false` to hide the respective row. |
