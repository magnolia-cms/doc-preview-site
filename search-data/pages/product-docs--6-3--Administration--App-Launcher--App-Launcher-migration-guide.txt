# Migrating to the 6.3 App Launcher design

The Magnolia 6.3 [App Launcher](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/App-Launcher/) uses a modern naming and groupings. The original Magnolia 6.2 **classic naming and grouping** is no longer available in Magnolia 6.3.

If you used a custom configuration of the App Launcher in Magnolia 6.2, you must migrate your definition for the 6.3 App Launcher.

## [](#_migration_notes)Migration notes

-   In Magnolia 6.3, the `layout` property defines [the grouping and layout of the App launcher](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/App-Launcher/App-launcher-layout/).

-   The respective YAML syntax differs from the [compatibilityLayout](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Administration/App-Launcher/Compatibility-app-launcher-layout.adoc) property, which is no longer available in Magnolia `6.3`.

-   Migration is possible for on-premise Magnolia installations or PaaS (Platform as a Service) subscriptions that still use the `compatibilityLayout` property.
