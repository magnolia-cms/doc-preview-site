# My first personalized campaign

In this tutorial you learn how to personalize content. You will target content to visitors from a particular country during a specific period of time. You learn how to create page variants and how to choose an audience. You also test the campaign with the Preview app.

## [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

Before you start:

-   Read [Personalization](../../../../use-cases/Personalization/) to understand the terms.

-   Install the [Personalization module](../).


## [](#_use_case_festival_tours)Use case: Festival tours

Various festivals are held in different countries on different dates throughout the year. Create a personalized campaign that promotes the Puck Fair festival to U.K. visitors and the Dragon Boat Festival to Chinese visitors.

Your tasks:

1.  Create a Festivals page.

2.  Create two personalized variants of the page. In each variant, add content that appeals to the target audience.

3.  Define U.K. and China as target countries using the Country trait.

4.  Run the campaign for two weeks prior to the festival date using the Date trait.

5.  Test the campaign to ensure that correct variant is served to visitors.

![Creating an orignal page example](../../../../_images/6-2-original-page.png)

## [](#_variant)Variant

A variant is an alternative content element that replaces the original element in personalized content delivery. Magnolia serves the variant instead of the original element when personalization rules match. A variant is a copy of the original element, edited to best suit the intended audience.

Create two [variants](../../../../use-cases/Personalization/) of the Festivals page:

1.  Select `/travel/festivals`

2.  Click **Add page variant** two times.


Magnolia creates two variants. The system also marks the original page with the variant icon ![The variant icon](../../../../_images/icon-variant.gif). This icon tells editors that the page has alternative content.

## [](#_preview_the_variants)Preview the variants

Test the campaign in the Preview app. Impersonate Chinese and U.K. visitors and verify that the correct content variant is served.

1.  Open the Preview app.

2.  Go to the festivals page.

    -   Expected result: The original page is served, not a personalized variant.
        ![Preview of the original page](../../../../_images/preview-default.png)


3.  Select a Chinese persona 王芳 Wang Fang.

    -   Expected result: The original page is still served because you have not defined a date.
        ![Preview of the page for the chinese persona](../../../../_images/preview-default-chinese-persona.png)


4.  Set **Date** to 2019-06-09 or any other day during the Chinese variant run dates.

    -   Expected result: The Chinese variant is served.
        ![Preview of the page for the chinese persona with the changed date](../../../../_images/preview-chinese-variant.png)


5.  Set **Country** to United Kingdom and **Date** to 2019-08-10 or any other day during the U.K. variant run dates.

    -   Expected result: The U.K. variant is served. This is an example where the country trait you explicitly chose (U.K) overrides the country of the persona (China).
