# Support from the Cockpit

You can view an overview of support tickets related to your DX Cloud project directly in the Cockpit. This centralized view displays ticket ID, title, status, reporter, type, and creation date for all ongoing support requests. Only tickets explicitly shared with your Organization are visible to you in the Cockpit.

Use the status filters and table columns to quickly track progress and identify tickets that need your attention.

In addition to the instructions here, you can find help directly embedded on the applicable Cockpit page.
