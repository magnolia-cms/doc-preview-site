# Support or Professional Services

This document clarifies the differences between Magnolia’s Standard Product Support and Professional Services offerings to help you understand how Magnolia can assist you.

## [](#_dx_core_and_dx_cloud_supporthelpdesk)DX Core and DX Cloud (Support/Helpdesk) 🛠️

Standard support offers structured technical assistance focused on Magnolia DX Core and DX Cloud including:

### [](#_dx_core)DX Core

-   Product-related troubleshooting

-   Bug reporting and investigation

-   Ensuring the reliability and stability of the core product


### [](#_dx_cloud)DX Cloud

-   Cockpit administration requests

-   General cloud support workflow question

-   Management of infrastructure requirements

-   Preparing a Go-Live


> **Tip:** For more details on DX Cloud support, see Support for DX Cloud Customers.

## [](#_how_it_works)How it works ⚙️

You can access support via our ticketing system. We define response times and service windows according to your SLA. Phone support is available exclusively for emergencies and only for DX Core or DX Cloud accounts with SLA-1 or SLA-3. Use it strictly for critical infrastructure-related issues, such as complete site outages, inaccessible sites, or security breaches/attacks.

> **Important:** Support does not cover consulting, configuration, architecture reviews, or training. It does not provide implementation support or strategic enablement.

## [](#_professional_services)Professional Services 🤝

Professional Services offers expert guidance to help you maximize Magnolia in your specific project context. Services include:

-   Expert guidance on implementation and configuration

-   Solution architecture guidance

-   Best practices and performance optimization

-   Project, code, or performance reviews

-   Customized workshops and instructor-led training


This service takes a proactive, consultative approach to ensure successful project execution, rather than acting as a reactive support channel.

## [](#_what_about_calls)What About Calls? ☎️

Neither Product Support nor Professional Services operates as a 24/7 call center. If you request a call that does not qualify as an emergency under your SLA, we will refer the request to Professional Services. A proper service engagement will be required, including scope definition, pricing, planning, and scheduling.

## [](#_additional_scope_clarifications)Additional Scope Clarifications ⚠️

Professional Services does not cover bug fixes, patches, or repairs to the Magnolia DX Core. It does not act as a managed service, outsourced team, or project maintainer. Our Solution Architects do not dedicate themselves to a single project long-term.

We provide our best advice and recommendations based on best practices. However, if you choose a different path, we cannot guarantee success or provide support beyond the agreed engagement.

> **Tip:** For long-term, embedded assistance or direct hands-on development, we recommend engaging with one of our certified Magnolia Partners.
