## [](#_out_of_scope)Out of scope

The following activities are explicitly excluded from the contract and will not be undertaken:

-   Extensions (Framework, Connector or Incubator) that require custom Java configuration

-   Major version upgrades

-   Custom Java Module Development and Deployment

-   Testing of releases on customer infrastructure/cloud subscription/environments

-   Management of headless front-end hosted on DX Cloud (falls outside the agreement)

-   Configuration services for third-party technology integrations into the project


## [](#_service_lifecycle)Service lifecycle

This section describes the typical flow for a Managed Service update from your perspective.

### [](#_1_magnolia_prepares_the_update)1\. Magnolia prepares the update

For each quarterly update or agreed security update, Magnolia:

-   Prepares a new Magnolia application bundle based on the target release

-   Aligns Helm charts and environment-specific `values.yml` so that DEV, UAT, and PROD are correctly configured

-   Updates CI/CD pipelines so that builds, tests, and deployments for the new bundle are automated


All of this is handled by Magnolia or a Magnolia-designated partner under Magnolia’s responsibility.

### [](#_2_staging_on_production_cluster)2\. Staging on production cluster

To reduce risk, Magnolia uses a blue/green-style approach:

-   A dedicated **STAGING** (or update) environment is spun up on the production cluster

-   Relevant production data is copied back to this environment

-   Traffic to this environment is protected behind Fastly so it is not publicly exposed

-   The environment is available for your team to test the new version


This staging window is time-limited (for example, up to five (5) days) to control infrastructure and scaling costs.

### [](#_3_customer_validation)3\. Customer validation

During the staging window, we expect you to:

-   Perform **happy-path** functional checks for key journeys

-   Validate both **headed** (traditional) and **headless** experiences where applicable

-   Confirm that light modules, configurations, and integrations behave as expected


If issues are found, Magnolia will address them and, if needed, repeat the staging cycle.

### [](#_4_bluegreen_deployment_to_production)4\. Blue/green deployment to production

In the following agreed window (typically the next week after successful staging validation), Magnolia:

-   Deploys the new bundle alongside the existing production version (blue/green)

-   Switches traffic to the updated environment once health and smoke checks pass

-   Monitors the system and can roll back to the previous version if a critical issue is detected


Security updates that **do not** introduce breaking changes may be deployed directly without a full quarterly staging cycle. Security updates that **do** introduce breaking changes follow the same quarterly update process described above.

### [](#_5_post_deployment_and_documentation)5\. Post-deployment and documentation

After a successful production cut-over, Magnolia:

-   Finalizes and publishes the updated blueprint(s) for the release

-   Updates the CI/CD pipelines and `values.yml` used for ongoing operations

-   Publishes customer-facing documentation and release notes (see below)


## [](#_deliverables)Deliverables

When a new bundle is released, you receive the following deliverables:

### [](#_blueprints)Blueprints

-   **Blueprint for light modules**: Template and structure for light module projects

-   **Blueprint for bundle**: Complete bundle blueprint

-   **Blueprint for Docker compose**: Docker composition configuration

-   **Blueprint for headless**: Headless implementation blueprint

-   **Blueprint for SSO**: Single Sign-On configuration blueprint (represented as flow)


> **Note:** Blueprints always use the latest Helm chart version.Blueprints are maintained in Magnolia’s GitLab (exact repository locations TBD).

### [](#_cicd_pipelines)CI/CD pipelines

Pipelines with testing steps for:

-   **DEV** environment

-   **UAT** environment

-   **PROD** environment


### [](#_bundle_version)Bundle version

New bundle version information and release notes, including:

-   Overview of new features and changes

-   All relevant Magnolia module version changes, including any configuration updates required

-   New modules added and modules deprecated or removed

-   Impact on light modules (for example, configuration changes or required updates)


## [](#_architecture_and_configuration)Architecture and configuration

### [](#_relationship_to_dx_cloud_architecture)Relationship to DX Cloud architecture

The underlying infrastructure for the DX Cloud Managed Service follows the same architecture as standard DX Cloud Basic, Standard, and Premium deployments. For an in-depth view of clusters, environments, and traffic routing, see [DX Cloud Architecture](../architecture/).

![paas managed service](../_images/managed-service/paas-managed-service.png)

What changes with the Managed Service is *who manages the application layer and update process*:

-   **Self-managed DX Cloud**: You (and/or your implementation partner) design, build, and operate the Magnolia application layer and deployment pipelines on top of the standard DX Cloud architecture.

-   **DX Cloud Managed Service**: Magnolia (and/or a Magnolia-designated partner) designs, builds, and operates the Magnolia application bundle and deployment pipelines for you, using the same underlying DX Cloud infrastructure.


Managed Service customers can still develop projects using light modules or headless approaches; the difference is that Magnolia owns the build and deployment process for the agreed stack.

### [](#_helm_charts)Helm charts

Blueprints always use the latest Helm chart version to ensure compatibility and access to the most recent features and security updates.

### [](#_deployment_configuration)Deployment configuration

Each deployment may have its own `values.yml` configuration file, allowing for environment-specific settings while maintaining consistency across the deployment pipeline.

### [](#_image_storage_and_access_control)Image storage and access control

Container images and bundles built as part of the Managed Service are stored in Magnolia-managed private registries and/or GitLab repositories (exact locations and access model TBD).

> **Note:** Access to these images is restricted to Magnolia and authorized Managed Service partners. Customer-facing details about image locations and access procedures will be documented here once finalized.

## [](#_troubleshooting)Troubleshooting

> **Note:** This section will be expanded as common issues are identified and resolved. For immediate assistance, contact your Technical Account Manager (TAM) or open a support ticket.
