# Part I - My first content type

In this tutorial, you learn how to create and use content types, how to create a content app based on a content type, how to adapt the app defaults and how to localize it. All the features developed within the tutorial will be part of a Magnolia [light module](../../../../Modules/Light-modules/).

The tutorial is suitable for beginners. However, if you are completely new to Magnolia, we recommend you try the [Hello Magnolia](../../../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Hello-Magnolia/) tutorial first.

Use the Magnolia Content type definition to specify a content type.

A Magnolia content type is a formal definition for a type of content in Magnolia including the properties the type may contain and its relationships to other types of content. A content type is configured in a content type definition that includes the **data source definition** and **model definition**.

Content type items can be managed by a content app. The content can be embedded into web pages or served via REST in a headless approach.

## [](#_use_case)Use case

*Magnolia Travels* is a travel agency that employs many tour guides. The marketing department of Magnolia Travels wants to promote their popular tour guides on their website as well as on other channels. They decide to record the following information for each tour guide:

-   Name

-   Birthdate

-   Gender

-   Short biography


### [](#_your_tasks)Your tasks

To begin, you need a Magnolia bundle where you will create a new light module to contain your code.

You will then configure a [content type definition](../../Content-type-definition/) to map the given use case. Then you will create a content app, referring to the content type definition, to manage data for the tour guides.

## [](#_getting_magnolia)Getting Magnolia

For development and testing you need a running [NOTE: instance](../../../../Administration/Instances/) of Magnolia. In this tutorial, we suppose that it is installed in a directory called `magnolia`.

If you don’t have Magnolia installed and running, go to the page called [Installing Magnolia through npm CLI](../../../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Installing-Magnolia/Installing-Magnolia-through-npm-CLI/) and complete the steps described on it. Then, return and proceed from here.

## [](#_creating_a_light_module)Creating a light module

The [light module](../../../../Modules/Light-modules/) serves as a container to which you will add the definitions for content types and for the apps based on those content types.

1.  Use the shell and change into the `light-modules` directory of your Magnolia installation.

2.  There, create the following folder structure:

    content-type-examples/
        ├── apps/
        ├── contentTypes/
        └── i18n/

    The files you create in the following sections will go into these three subfolders.

    > **Note:** Alternatively, you could use the following Magnolia CLI command to create the light module:npm run mgnl -- create-light-module content-type-examplesHowever, as this command creates more folders than required for this tutorial, we recommend that you create the folder structure manually as shown above.
