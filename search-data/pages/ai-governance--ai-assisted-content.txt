# AI use in documentation

## [](#_overview)Overview

Some (but not all) pages in this documentation are created or maintained with the assistance of AI-based tools. AI assistance is used to plan, draft, edit, and summarize some content.

> **Important:** AI tools do not make final decisions about content.

## [](#_human_review_and_accountability)Human review and accountability

All AI-assisted content is subject to our standard documentation lifecycle, which includes:

-   Peer review by qualified contributors

-   Editorial and technical validation

-   Approval prior to publication

-   Version control and change tracking


Responsibility for published content always remains with human authors and reviewers.

## [](#_data_protection_and_confidentiality)Data protection and confidentiality

AI-assisted tools are used in accordance with our information security and data protection policies.

In particular:

-   No customer personal data, confidential information, or proprietary customer content is provided to AI tools.

-   Inputs are limited to non-sensitive, approved source material.

-   AI tools are not granted access to internal systems or production data.


## [](#_scope_and_limitations)Scope and limitations

AI assistance is used selectively and may vary by page or section. Not all documentation content is AI-assisted.

This disclosure applies only to documentation content and does not imply automated decision-making or AI use in operational, contractual, or customer-facing processes.

## [](#_governance)Governance

The use of AI-assisted tools is governed by our AI usage policy and related internal controls, which define acceptable use, review requirements, and data handling rules.
