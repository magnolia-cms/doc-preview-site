# Installing Apache Solr

This page describes how to install and start Apache Solr and create a new Solr core based on a Magnolia configuration set.

[Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) is a standalone enterprise-grade search platform needed together with the Magnolia Solr module for high-performance searches of a large document set.

The installation procedure for Apache Solr described on this page is reduced to a minimum of steps required to set up, start, and use Solr with a Magnolia instance.

> **Tip:** For a full account, please refer to the official Solr documentation at solr.apache.org/guide/.

## [](#_solr_module_compatibility_with_apache_solr)Solr module compatibility with Apache Solr

| Magnolia Solr module version | Solr version |
| --- | --- |
| `9.0.x` | `9.x` |
| `6.1.x` | `8.x` |

## [](#_getting_apache_solr)Getting Apache Solr

[Download Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html) and extract the zip to your computer.

## [](#_creating_a_configuration_set)Creating a configuration set

Create a new Magnolia configuration set by duplicating the `$SOLR_HOME/server/solr/configsets/_default` folder and then naming it as `magnolia_data_driven_schema_configs`.

In this new configuration set, you need to create or modify two files, `solrconfig.xml` and `managed-schema`:

-   `solrconfig.xml`, a configuration file with the most parameters affecting Solr itself.

-   `managed-schema`, a file that specifies:

    -   which fields the Magnolia content can contain,

    -   how those fields are added to the index,

    -   how they are queried.



> **Tip:** For further details, see https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/configuration-guide/configuration-files.html.

### [](#_configuration_example)Configuration example

> **Caution:** Please be aware that different Solr versions may require different content in the Solr configuration files. The example Solr 9.x configuration files attached below are for Solr 9.7.0 and tested against version 6.3.2 of the Magnolia Solr module.

The configuration files are managed in the [Solr Search Provider module](../). Download the Solr `9.x` [`sample-solr-config-files`](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/documentation/public-doc-samples/-/tree/master/sample-solr-config-files) or Solr `8.x` [`sample-solr-config-files`](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/documentation/public-doc-samples/-/tree/release/6.1) (based on Solr data\_driven\_schema\_configs [Config sets](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/configuration-guide/config-sets.html)) and replace with them the default files in the newly created set `magnolia_data_driven_schema_configs/conf`.

## [](#_starting_solr)Starting Solr

Go to the `$SOLR_HOME/bin` folder and start the Solr server:

```console
./solr start
```

## [](#_check_if_solr_is_running)Check if Solr is running

Check if Solr is running by executing the following command:

```cosole
./solr status
```

## [](#_creating_a_new_core)Creating a new core

A core is a running instance of a Lucene index along with all the Solr configuration required to use it. Create a new core called `magnolia`:

```console
./solr create_core -c magnolia -d magnolia_data_driven_schema_configs
```

## [](#_use_the_admin_dashboard)Use the admin dashboard

By opening [http://localhost:8983/solr/](http://localhost:8983/solr/), you may use Solr’s admin dashboard. From there, you can also create cores.

> **Note:** The type of installation described above works for testing and development purposes. For production installation, see Taking Solr to Production (Solr latest).
