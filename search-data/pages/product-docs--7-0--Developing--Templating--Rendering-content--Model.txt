# Model

A template model provides properties and methods which can be accessed in the corresponding template script.

The model can be implemented in Java or - since Magnolia 5.5.6 it can also be written in JavaScript following [Light development](../../../Light-development-in-Magnolia/) approach - thus enabling fast development and deployment without the need for Java, Maven or WAR deployment.

This page covers Java based models. For the JS based models please read [How to work with JavaScript models](../../../Development-how-tos/How-to-work-with-JavaScript-models/).

This is an advanced topic.

It is not necessary to use a model in Magnolia templating, but it is useful. If you are starting out with Magnolia use [templating functions](../../Template-scripts/Templating-functions/) instead of a model. Model classes cannot be added to [light modules](../../../../Modules/#_light_module) because light modules cannot contain their own Java classes. However, a light module can reference a [component model](../../../../Modules/List-of-modules/MTE-module/#_Componentmodels) from another module such as [MTE](#_MTEcomponentmodels).

A model can execute any Java code to retrieve data from the JCR repository or from an external source.

## [](#_what_is_a_model)What is a model?

A model is written as a Java model class. It is a JavaBean where business logic resides. The model class is the entry point for custom Java logic for the template script. All [templates](../../Template-definition/) - [page](../../Template-definition/Page-definition/), [area](../../Template-definition/Area-definition/) and [component](../../Template-definition/Component-definition/) - can define a model class.

## [](#_how_does_a_model_work)How does a model work?

During the [rendering process](../#_steps_involved_in_rendering_content), the renderer calls the model’s `execute()` before it calls the template script. The return value of the `execute` method is passed to the template script with the `actionResult` object.

The model class:

-   Is instantiated for each rendering process.

-   Is provided to the respective script as an object [model](../../Template-scripts/Rendering-context-objects/#_model).

-   Is provided the [current content](../../Template-scripts/Rendering-context-objects/#_content), the [current page definition](../../Template-scripts/Rendering-context-objects/#_def) and any [parent model](../../Template-scripts/Rendering-context-objects/#_model).


All of the model’s public methods can be [accessed](#_Acessingmodelmethods) by the template script.

## [](#_benefits_of_using_a_model)Benefits of using a model

There are a number of benefits to using a model:

-   Provides a clean separation between script rendering and business logic. You can change business logic without changing rendering logic.

-   Different page, area and component templates can use the same business logic.

-   Interaction between template scripts and their models can be predefined during the conceptual project phase.

-   Model classes and template scripts can be developed independently,

-   Because the model is a Java class, you can use all Magnolia Java components.

-   Model classes are reusable and can be subclassed.

-   You can retain control of the business logic by preventing changes by front-end script developers.


## [](#_referencing_a_model)Referencing a model

All templates can use a model class. The model class is referenced in the `modelClass` property in the [template definition](../../Template-definition/#_common_template_properties).

**Example**: A home page template that uses a model class

/my-module/templates/pages/home.yaml

```js
renderType: freemarker
templateScript: /my-module/templates/pages/home.ftl
dialog: my-module:pages/homePageProperties
modelClass: com.example.templates.HomePageModel
```

## [](#_using_model_methods)Using model methods

Model classes provide their own methods. You can use any `public` method in your templates. The methods are exposed using the `model.<method name>` notation.

> **Warning:** All getters without parameters can be accessed without the `get' part of the method name and without the method brackets. Methods that expect parameters can only be called by the full method declaration.

**Example**: How to use model methods in your templates

Model class method

Usage in a template script

```java
 public String getName()
```

${model.name}
${model.getName()}

```java
 public Collection getLatestNews()
```

${model.latestNews}
${model.getLatestNews()}

```java
 public boolean isArchivedNews()
```

 if\]
${model.archivedNews?string}
${model.isArchivedNews()?string}

```java
public String getContact(String contactName)
```

 ${model.getContact("marilyn")}

## [](#_model_constructor)Model constructor

These following [objects](../../Template-scripts/Rendering-context-objects/) are passed into the constructor of a model:

-   [current content](../../Template-scripts/Rendering-context-objects/#_content): The content of the current rendered template.

-   [current definition](../../Template-scripts/Rendering-context-objects/#_def): The template definition of the current rendered template.

-   [parent model](../../Template-scripts/Rendering-context-objects/#_model): Is the parent model of the last render cycle.


> **Warning:** The constructor of a model uses Java Generics. The used definition can be defined by generics. No casts are needed.

```java
public class NavigationComponentModel<RD extends ConfiguredTemplateDefinition> extends RenderingModelImpl<ConfiguredTemplateDefinition> {

    public NavigationComponentModel(Node content, ConfiguredTemplateDefinition definition, RenderingModel<?> parent) throws PathNotFoundException, RepositoryException {
        super(content, definition, parent);
    }

}
```
