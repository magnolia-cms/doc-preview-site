# Tab completion

The Magnolia CLI provides tab autocompletion support for Bash and Windows PowerShell.

## [](#_enabling_tab_completion)Enabling tab completion

Navigate to your project root and run the following command:

```console
npm run mgnl -- tab-completion
```

You’ll be prompted to choose the installation type:

```console
? Which tab completion installation do you want? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Local only (using: `npm run mgnl` or `yarn mgnl` command)
  Global only (using: `mgnl` command)
  Both local and global
```

To reinstall tab completion with a different option, use:

```console
npm run mgnl -- tab-completion --reinstall
```

After a successful installation, the CLI adds the a completion script to the appropriate configuration files and sets `tabCompletion: true` in the `mgnl.config.js` file.

> **Tip:** You must restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

To test whether tab completion is working, type `npm run mgnl` (or `mgnl` if installed globally) and press the **Tab** key to view the list of available commands and options.

> **Note:** On the first run, there might be a short delay while the script loads and caches available commands.

## [](#_disabling_tab_completion)Disabling tab completion

To disable tab completion for the current project, run:

```console
npm run mgnl -- tab-completion --disable
```

Alternatively, you can manually set `tabCompletion: false` in the `mgnl.config.js` file.

> **Note:** The --disable flag doesn’t remove the installed script. It only disables autocompletion for the current project. Other projects with tabCompletion: true will still support command suggestions.

## [](#_uninstalling_tab_completion)Uninstalling tab completion

To completely remove tab completion, use the following command:

```console
npm run mgnl -- tab-completion --uninstall
```

> **Note:** This command sets tabCompletion: false in the current project and removes the installed scripts. Projects with tabCompletion: true will no longer support tab completion unless the scripts are reinstalled.
