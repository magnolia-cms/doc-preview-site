## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.sso</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-sso</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.6</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

| Prerequisite | Description |
| --- | --- |
| a user | **required** Its username and password are used to access Admincentral. It should have names as well as an email. |
| a group | **required** When the user logs in, it has to belong (in Keycloak’s eyes, that is either in Keycloak directly, or in a user federation provider) to at least one group defined in the group mappings. That’s how the necessary access to Magnolia is granted. |
| an OIDC client | **required** With the following properties: |
| a name | **required** Must be the same as the one used in the YAML configuration of the module. |
| the `openid-connect` protocol | **required** |
| a confidential access type | **required** This is required in order for Keycloak to generate credentials. |
| credentials | **required** Those must be shared with the YAML configuration of the module. |
| a redirect URI | **required** That points back to Magnolia, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/*` . |
| a Group Membership mapper | **required** By convention, this is required in order to include the user’s groups in the `groups` property ( info.magnolia.sso.oidc.GroupsAuthorizationGenerator ). Without this data, a user won’t be assigned any Magnolia permission, and hence won’t be able to go past the login screen. Here’s how to configure the mapper in various applications: |
