# My first content app Part II

## [](#_creating_a_basic_content_app)Creating a basic content app

This page is the second part of the [My first content app](../) tutorial and describes how to configure and create a basic Bookshelf, a Magnolia content app.

The configuration is done using Magnolia content types – formal definitions for types of content in Magnolia including the properties the type may contain and its relationships to other types of content.

### [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

For development and testing, you need a running [instance](../../../../Administration/Instances/) of Magnolia. In this tutorial, we suppose that it’s installed in a directory called `magnolia`.

> **Note:** If you don’t have Magnolia installed and running, go to Installing Magnolia through npm CLI and complete the steps described on it. Then, return and proceed from here.

### [](#_creating_the_bookshelf_light_module)Creating the `bookshelf` light module

Magnolia [light modules](../../../../Modules/Light-modules/) usually define page, area and component [templates](../../../../Developing/Templating/) and many more things.

In this tutorial, we use a light module called `bookshelf` to create a content app. The module contains both a definition of content types and the [app descriptor](../../../App-configuration/App-descriptor/).

1.  Open a terminal.

2.  Go to the `light-modules` folder of your Magnolia installation:

3.  Run the following command:

    ```console
    npm run mgnl -- create-light-module bookshelf
    ```

    The command creates the `bookshelf` light module after you confirm the folder location.

    ```text
    bookshelf
    ├── README.md
    ├── decorations
    ├── dialogs
    │   ├── components
    │   └── pages
    ├── i18n
    │   └── bookshelf-messages_en.properties
    ├── includes
    │   └── README.txt
    ├── templates
    │   ├── components
    │   └── pages
    └── webresources
    ```


### [](#_creating_the_app)Creating the app

In the `bookshelf` folder, enter the following command:

```console
npm run mgnl -- create-app bookshelf-app
```

When asked, confirm the name of the content type suggested by the CLI: `bookshelf-app`.

The command creates the `apps` and `contentTypes` subfolders in the light module and adds the `bookshelf-app.yaml` file to both of them.

```text
bookshelf
├── README.md
├── apps
│   └── bookshelf-app.yaml (1)
├── contentTypes
│   └── bookshelf-app.yaml (2)
├── decorations
├── dialogs
│   ├── components
│   └── pages
├── i18n
│   └── bookshelf-messages_en.properties
├── includes
│   └── README.txt
├── templates
│   ├── components
│   └── pages
└── webresources
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The `bookshelf-app.yaml` file in the `apps` subfolder is an app descriptor. |
| **2** | The `bookshelf-app.yaml` file in the `contentTypes` subfolder contains a content type definition for the app. |

As the function of the content type definition in this module is to describe a book, rename the content type definition file to `book.yaml`.

In the next steps, you modify these files to meet the design requirements for the Bookshelf app.

> **Caution:** The create-app command also creates a new workspace called bookshelf-app. However, as the Bookshelf app must interact with the books workspace, the name of the workspace is changed to books below.

#### [](#_customizing_the_content_type_definition)Customizing the content type definition

In the `contentTypes` folder, open the `book.yaml` file and replace its content with the following:

book.yaml (content type definition)

```yaml
datasource: (1)
  $type: jcrContentTypeDatasource
  workspace: books
  namespaces:
    lib: https://www.magnolia-travel.com/jcr/1.0/lib
  autoCreate: true

model: (2)
  nodeType: lib:book
  properties: (3)
    - name: authors
    - name: ed (4)
      type: Boolean
    - name: title
    - name: description
    - name: publisher
    - name: publish_date (5)
      type: Date
    - name: isbn13
```

**1**Defines how the content type items are persisted.

> **Note:** For more details see the Content type Data source definition page.

**2**Defines the node type and the properties of the new content item for the Bookshelf app.**3**Defines the app properties.

> **Note:** Defaults to the String type if no other type is supplied.

**4**Set the type of the `ed` property to `Boolean` since it is more appropriate in regard to the values the system can store (`true`, `false`).**5**Set the data type of the `publish_date` property to `Date` so that the value would be stored in the JCR as calendar object.

#### [](#_customizing_the_app_descriptor)Customizing the app descriptor

In the `apps` subfolder, open the `bookshelf-app.yaml` file and make sure it contains only the following two lines:

bookshelf-app.yaml (app descriptor)

```yml
!content-type:book (1)
name: bookshelf-app (2)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The app descriptor instructs the app generator to construct the app from the `book` content type definition. |
| **2** | You give the app the name `bookshelf-app`, under which the app is known to other resources and systems in Magnolia. |

#### [](#_check_the_app_in_the_definitions_app)Check the app in the Definitions app

After saving the changes, run `mgnl start` if your Magnolia isn’t running yet. Then, go to the [Definitions app](../../../List-of-apps/Definitions-app/) on the author instance to check that the app’s definitions have been loaded by Magnolia (the `bookshelf-app` should appear in the `apps` folder).

In case the `bookshelf-app` isn’t there or there’s a problem notification next to it, please double-check that all your `yaml` files have been copied exactly as they appear in this tutorial.

### [](#_starting_the_app)Starting the app

Magnolia adds a tile for your new app to the **App launcher** automatically when registering the app.

![App launcher tile](../../../../_images/6-3-partIICreatingABasicContentApp-appInLauncher.png)

i18n message keys and the Name, Title and Description labels

The `magnolia-ui-framework` module already contains several generic i18n message keys whose values are applied as labels in the UI of the Bookshelf app.

![Bookshelf detail subapp](../../../../_images/6-3-partIICreatingABasicContentApp-detailDefault.png)

In the last part of the tutorial, you create new label values in subsection [Adding an i18n message bundle](../Part-III---Fine-tuning-a-basic-content-app/#_adding_an_i18n_message_bundle).

Congratulations! The content app is up and running now.

**Continue to [My first content app Part III](../Part-III---Fine-tuning-a-basic-content-app/), where you fine-tune this raw app to a final form.**
