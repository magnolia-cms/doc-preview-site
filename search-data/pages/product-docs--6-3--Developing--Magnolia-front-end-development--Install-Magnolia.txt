# Install Magnolia

This page provides instructions on how to do a basic installation of Magnolia using the Magnolia CLI *v4*. You should do this before starting the [Hello Magnolia for front-end developers](../Hello-Magnolia-for-front-end-developers/) tutorial.

| **Check for JAVA_HOME** | • Open the command prompt. • Type `set` and press `ENTER` . • Find `JAVA_HOME` in the command output and verify that the path points to your JDK installation directory, for example, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>>.xx` . • If `JAVA_HOME` is missing or it points to the wrong directory, see **Set JAVA_HOME** . |
| **Set JAVA_HOME** | • Open the Command Prompt as an administrator. • Set the path for `JAVA_HOME` . `setx /m JAVA_HOME "path\to\Java\jdk" (1)` ** **1** Where `path\to\Java\jdk` is where your Java Development Kit is saved. The `set` command creates the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and sets its value to the JDK directory. The command is executed when Magnolia starts. | ** **1** | Where `path\to\Java\jdk` is where your Java Development Kit is saved. |

## [](#_get_node_js)Get node.js

Magnolia CLI is an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package providing a command line interface (CLI) tool to set up and facilitate light development with Magnolia. The Magnolia CLI tool runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you do not have Node.js installed, go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and download and install the latest LTS version.

To check the version of your node installation, run the following command in a shell:

node -v

## [](#_get_magnolia_cli)Get Magnolia CLI

Run the following command in a shell to install [Magnolia CLI](../../../../../magnolia-cli/):

-   Mac or Linux

-   Windows


```console
sudo npm install @magnolia/cli -g
```

```console
npm install @magnolia/cli -g (1)
```

| **1** | Depending on your permissions and the location where you have installed Node.js, you may have to execute the command above with root permissions. Without installation permissions you will notice messages such as `npm ERR!` in the shell. |

Once you have installed Magnolia CLI, test the installation by running the following command in the shell:

```console
mgnl help
```

The command should display the following:

```console
[mgnl 5]
Usage:   [options] [command]

```

## [](#_installing_magnolia_with_cli_only)Installing Magnolia with CLI only

Use the `jumpstart` command to install Magnolia. This command downloads, unpacks and pre-configures a Magnolia bundle of your choice.

> **Tip:** To install a specific Magnolia version, use the -m flag, for example:npx @magnolia/cli@latest jumpstart --magnolia "6.3.0"To see a list of options available for any Magnolia CLI command, use the command together with the -h flag, for example:npm run mgnl -- create-page -h

Windows users using [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) must enclose the two consecutive hyphens (`--`) in quotes:

```console
npm run mgnl "--" ...
```

To install Magnolia:

1.  Change to the directory to where you want to install the Magnolia bundle. For example:

    ```console
    cd /Users/<username>/dev/
    ```

2.  Execute the Magnolia CLI [`jumpstart`](../../../../../magnolia-cli/plugins/available-plugins/jumpstart-plugin/) plugin command:

    ```console
    mgnl jumpstart
    ```

3.  Choose the `demo-webapps` template, followed by the `magnolia-community-demo-webapp` template containing Magnolia Community Edition bundled with the [Travel Demo](../../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Demo/) and a Tomcat server. It creates folders for the Tomcat server and for the light modules according to the CLI configuration.

    Once the setup operation is complete, you should see a message similar to this one:

    ```console
    info: Project successfully downloaded
    info: Run "npm run mgnl" to see the list of registered commands
    info: Start the project using: "npm run mgnl -- start"
    info: If the "StartPlugin" is not available, install it using: "npm run mgnl -- add-plugin @magnolia/cli-start-plugin"
    info: For additional plugins and features, refer to the Magnolia CLI documentation: https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/magnolia-cli
    ```


## [](#_start_magnolia_with_cli)Start Magnolia with CLI

Go to the parent directory of the `apache-tomcat` directory and execute the [Magnolia CLI](../../../../../magnolia-cli/) `start` command:

mgnl start

When starting for the first time, Magnolia runs a web update and automatically installs all its modules.

## [](#_login)Login

Go to [`http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor`](http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor) and sign in as a `superuser` :

-   Username: `superuser`

-   Password: `superuser`


Magnolia is ready to use and gives you a list of suggestions to get started.

> **Note:** superuser is a system administrator account that has permissions to do everything. It is useful for testing.
