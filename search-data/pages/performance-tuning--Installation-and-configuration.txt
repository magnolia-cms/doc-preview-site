# Configuration and deployment

## [](#_overview)Overview

The best deployment option depends on your project’s specific requirements and constraints. Each option has advantages and considerations so that the optimal choice will vary based on scalability, cost, security, and maintenance needs.

Tuning tips - Configuration and deployment

-   **Deploying instances**

    -   Implement loose coupling between instances for independent operation.

    -   Consider scalability by connecting a single author instance to multiple public instances.

    -   Increase flexibility by serving separate variations of content on different public instances.

        For more, see [Benefits of separate author and public instances](Instances/#_benefits).


-   **Centralized data flow** with instances running in separate virtual machines for more performance.

    For more, see [Centralized database server](Clustering/#_option_2_centralized database server).

-   **Clustered deployment**

    -   Ensure you fully control the virtual machines (VMs) in a cluster setup.

    -   Avoid treating public instances as disposable with automatic up/down scaling based on load.

    -   Ensure the amount of writing (JCR) data is not too high.

        For more, see [Conditions for clustering](Clustering/#_conditions_for_clustering).

-   [Instances](Instances/)

    The instances page explains how instance setup affects performance. For example, adding a new public instance to serve the same content helps the existing instances cope with the load.
