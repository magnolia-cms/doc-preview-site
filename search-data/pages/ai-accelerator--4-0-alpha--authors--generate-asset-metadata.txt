# Generate asset metadata

**Available from version `2.2.6`**

Generate asset metadata with a configured AI model and task parameters. Configure a model as described in [Model configuration](../../developers/model-configuration/). As with all tasks, the default model applies unless you override it for the `generateAssetMetadata` task by decoration.

## [](#_features)Features

The `generateAssetMetadata` task provides: \* A configurable action using `jcrCommandAction` \* An observation listener that can auto-generate metadata when an asset changes \* A Groovy script to bulk-generate metadata for assets in DAM

## [](#_usage)Usage

The animation shows running the action in the Assets app. The caption field is populated in English and German.
