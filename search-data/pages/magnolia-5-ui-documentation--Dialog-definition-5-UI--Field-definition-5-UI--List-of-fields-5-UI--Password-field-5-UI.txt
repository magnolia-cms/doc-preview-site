# Password field - 5 UI

Deprecated

> **Note:** This password field definition has been deprecated since Magnolia 6.0. It is part of the Magnolia 5 UI framework.For the updated implementation, see Password field for Magnolia 6 UI instead.

`PasswordFieldDefinition` renders two text boxes for entry and verification of passwords. The input text is masked in the field, but the value is stored as clear text in the JCR.

If you want to store hashed password values, you can:

-   Use the password field to collect the value of the password entered by the user and delegate the storage of the password and hashing to an underlying [user manager](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Modules/List-of-modules/LDAP-Connector-module.adoc#_user_manager). The user manager may be an internal Magnolia user manager or an external user manager. See the [Security app](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app.adoc) for an example of this approach.

-   Configure `BCryptTransformer` in the password field by specifying a `transformerClass` property in the field definition:

    ```none
    transformerClass = info.magnolia.ui.form.field.transformer.basic.BCryptTransformer
    ```


> **Warning:** If you store a hashed value, you can no longer decode it to clear text. This is suitable when you want to authenticate against the password and only compare the stored hash against the hash of the password provided when logging in. If you need passwords in plain text so that they can be used to access other systems requiring authentication, we recommend you use the Magnolia Password Manager module.
