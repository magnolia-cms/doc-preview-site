# Templates in MTK

[FreeMarker development only](../Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia)

This page explains how to use the Magnolia Templating Kit (MTK), provided as a submodule of the Magnolia Templating Essentials module (MTE).

## [](#_what_is_the_mte)What is the MTE

[Magnolia Templating Essentials](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/MTE-module/) (MTE) provides useful templating functionality for all projects in the form of templating function libraries, definitions, imaging support and templates via the MTK submodule. MTE is front-end framework agnostic, which means you can use it with any modern CSS and JS framework.

## [](#_what_is_mtk)What is MTK

The [Magnolia Templating Kit](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/MTE-module/MTK-module/) (MTK) is a small set of ready-to-use component, area and page templates supplying basic functionality that is common across websites. The templates are designed to be flexible, with dialog options enabling them to fit many use cases without development. The MTK templates can be used as is, modified to suit your project needs or referenced as helpful examples of best-practice Magnolia templating. The MTK is intentionally small so that developers can learn it quickly. CSS is kept to a minimum to enable developers to easily integrate their own CSS or frameworks.

In addition to the standard Maven module, the MTK is also available as a light module for easy access to the files. To get the latest version, see the download area on the [release notes pages](../../../Releases/).

> **Tip:** To experiment with Magnolia templating, put the unzipped MTK light module in Magnolia’s resource directory and make changes to the files. Due to Magnolia’s resource-loading mechanism, these files will be used instead of the ones in the Java classpath provided by the Maven module.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `htmlHeader` | noComponent | [htmlHeader.ftl](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/modules/templating-essentials/-/blob/master/magnolia-templating-kit-2/src/main/resources/mtk2/templates/areas/htmlHeader.ftl) | Page properties dialog | Using the MTK page properties dialog editors can control some of the metadata rendered to the page. |
| `navigation` | noComponent | [navigation.ftl](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/modules/templating-essentials/-/blob/master/magnolia-templating-kit-2/src/main/resources/mtk2/templates/areas/navigation.ftl) | Browser subapp | The script uses the site hierarchy defined in the browser subapp to render a menu of the site. It has no dialog and no components may be added directly through the detail subapp. |
| `main` | list | *default script* | Detail subapp | Content editors define the essence of the page here. By using the components provided by MTK editors can pick what kind of content should be rendered and where. |
| `footer` | list | *default script* | Detail subapp | A special type of area inherited on all pages. The footer is typically uniform in content and edited from the home page to maintain consistency. |
