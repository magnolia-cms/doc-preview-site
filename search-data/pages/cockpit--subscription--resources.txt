# Subscription Resources Help

This section provides documentation for cluster resource usage and capacity metrics.

## [](#_nodes_prod)nodes-prod

**Production Nodes**

This metric shows the number of Kubernetes nodes allocated to your production clusters.

-   **Measured:** Current number of active nodes

-   **Contracted:** Number of nodes in your subscription plan

-   **Impact:** Affects compute capacity, redundancy, and availability


Production nodes handle your live website traffic and are critical for maintaining high availability and performance.

## [](#_nodes_nonprod)nodes-nonProd

**Non-Production Nodes**

This shows the number of Kubernetes nodes allocated to your development, testing, or staging clusters.

-   **Measured:** Current number of active nodes

-   **Contracted:** Number of nodes in your subscription plan

-   **Usage:** Development, testing, and staging environments


Non-production nodes provide isolated environments for development and testing before deploying to production.

## [](#_nodes_satelites)nodes-satelites

**Satellite Nodes**

This displays the number of nodes allocated to satellite clusters, typically used for specialized workloads or geographic distribution.

-   **Measured:** Current number of active satellite nodes

-   **Contracted:** Number of satellite nodes in your subscription

-   **Purpose:** Specialized workloads, edge computing, or regional distribution


Satellite nodes extend your Magnolia infrastructure to specific regions or use cases.

## [](#_cpu_prod)cpu-prod

**Production CPU**

This metric shows CPU core usage across your production clusters.

-   **Reserved:** CPU cores currently allocated to running workloads

-   **Available:** Additional CPU capacity available for scaling

-   **Contracted:** Total CPU cores in your subscription plan


CPU usage directly impacts application performance and response times for your live websites.

## [](#_cpu_nonprod)cpu-nonProd

**Non-Production CPU**

This shows CPU core usage across your development and testing clusters.

-   **Reserved:** CPU cores currently allocated to running workloads

-   **Available:** Additional CPU capacity available

-   **Contracted:** Total CPU cores allocated to non-production environments


Non-production CPU supports development workflows, testing, and staging activities.

## [](#_cpu_satelites)cpu-satelites

**Satellite CPU**

This displays CPU usage across satellite clusters for specialized workloads.

-   **Reserved:** CPU cores currently allocated

-   **Available:** Additional CPU capacity

-   **Contracted:** Total CPU cores for satellite clusters


## [](#_memory_prod)memory-prod

**Production Memory**

This metric shows RAM usage across your production Magnolia clusters.

-   **Reserved:** Memory currently allocated to running applications (in GB)

-   **Available:** Additional memory available for scaling (in GB)

-   **Contracted:** Total memory in your subscription plan (in GB)


Memory usage affects application performance, caching effectiveness, and the ability to handle traffic spikes.

## [](#_memory_nonprod)memory-nonProd

**Non-Production Memory**

This shows memory usage across your development and testing environments.

-   **Reserved:** Memory currently allocated to running applications (in GB)

-   **Available:** Additional memory available (in GB)

-   **Contracted:** Total memory allocated to non-production (in GB)


Non-production memory supports development activities and testing workloads.

## [](#_memory_satelites)memory-satelites

**Satellite Memory**

This displays memory usage across satellite clusters.

-   **Reserved:** Memory currently allocated (in GB)

-   **Available:** Additional memory available (in GB)

-   **Contracted:** Total memory for satellite clusters (in GB)


Satellite memory supports specialized workloads and regional deployments.
