# Release notes for Magnolia CMS 6.3.8

[LTS release](#support:ROOT:index.adoc) • Delivered on April 28, 2025 • Page updated on May 5, 2025 • Changelog: [17305](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=17305)

**Magnolia 6.3.8** is a bug-fixing and security-focused release, introducing key enhancements for performance and efficiency. Notable updates include support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to sign publication requests and the new `canSkipProperty` and `excludeProperty` indexing rules, which significantly optimize indexing.

We keep the details of security fixes private in line with our [security policy](../../Administration/Security/Security-policy/). Contact our [Support team](#support:ROOT:index.adoc) if you need more information.

## [](#_breaking_changes)Breaking changes

### [](#_restricted_access_to_component_variants_on_public_instances)Restricted access to component variants on public instances

Two default voters prevent direct rendering of `mgnl:variant` nodes via the URL. See [restricting node type rendering](../../Administration/Architecture/Request-processing-and-filters/Filters/#_restricting_node_type_rendering).

## [](#_improvements)Improvements

### [](#_new_signature_mechanism_for_publication_tasks)New signature mechanism for publication tasks

You can now configure Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to sign publication requests. Due to ECC’s shorter key length, it is more performant than RSA signing. With the addition of this signature mechanism, it’s also possible to use cipher algorithms other than RSA for [data encryption](../../Administration/Architecture/Configuration-management/#_defining_properties).

> **Note:** ECC signature was not yet supported on Magnolia DX Cloud at the time of release. From May 5, 2025, DX Cloud customers can avail of the ECC feature. See the DX Cloud changelog for more details.

### [](#_new_canskipproperty_and_excludeproperty_indexing_rules)New `canSkipProperty` and `excludeProperty` indexing rules

The `canSkipProperty` and `excludeProperty` indexing rules allow fine-grained control over which properties are excluded from indexing, improving performance and storage efficiency.

> **Note:** This is an experimental feature. It’s disabled by default and must be enabled in the magnolia.properties configuration file of the Magnolia instance where you want to apply indexing optimization.magnolia.repositories.jackrabbit.indexing.optimization=trueYou can also set it at the JVM level using the -D flag:-Dmagnolia.repositories.jackrabbit.indexing.optimization=true

For more, see [Skipping properties](../../Administration/Jackrabbit-search/#_skipping_properties).
