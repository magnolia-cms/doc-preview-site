# Preview app

The Preview app allows you to test [personalized](../../../use-cases/Personalization/) content. You can impersonate a visitor to verify that the correct page variant is served. The impersonated visitor can be a [persona](../../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Glossary/#_persona) or a mix of local [traits](../../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Glossary/#_trait). The Preview app looks just like the preview in the Pages app but it has a sidebar for selecting the persona and traits.

## [](#_previewing)Previewing

To preview a page variant:

1.  Open the Preview app.

2.  In the Preview app, go to a page that has a variant. If the original page is served instead of the variant this is probably because you are impersonating an anonymous user by default. The anonymous user likely does not match the audience of the variant.

3.  Select a persona that matches the audience or select local traits that match the audience. The variant is now served.


See [My first personalized campaign](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Personalization-module/My-first-personalized-campaign/) for a full hands-on tutorial that includes previewing page variants.
