# Hello Magnolia

In this beginner tutorial, you will create a simple web page based on a custom-built light module called `hello-magnolia`. Your light module will provide a page template and a custom `quotation` component for a web page. You will learn how to get content from a repository and display it on the page to make it look something like this:

![Final page view](../../_images/helloPage_final.png)

You will develop the page using [Magnolia CLI](../../../../magnolia-cli/), an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com.adoc) package which facilitates light development with Magnolia.

Each page of the Hello Magnolia tutorial is tagged with the Hello Magnolia label to help you keep on track.

> **Tip:** Are you planning a headless project? Start with Jumpstarting a headless Magnolia project.

**Tutorial steps**

1.  First, we’ll [get Magnolia](Getting-Magnolia/) if we haven’t installed it already.

2.  We’ll [create the light module](Create-light-module/) to kick off this tutorial.

3.  Then, we’ll [create the page template](Create-page-template/).

4.  Next, we’ll [create a page based on the template](Create-page-based-on-template/) we had just worked on in the previous step.

5.  We’ll have a look at how to [create an area and the quotation component](Create-area-quotation-component/).

6.  Finally, we’ll [add the component to the page](Add-component-to-page/) and see what our page looks like on the public instance.
