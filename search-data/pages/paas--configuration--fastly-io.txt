# Fastly Image Optimizer

DX Cloud uses Fastly’s Image Optimizer (IO) to optimize assets.

Fastly’s Image Optimizer (IO) works with images and caches optimized versions of those images. It interacts with the **fetch node** in the **shield Point of Presence (POP)** . Since images and variations of images are handled within Fastly instead of within Magnolia itself, it helps minimize any lag or heavy lifting from the Magnolia side of things.

If you want to know more, check out Fastly’s dedicated [IO documentation](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/io/).

### [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

-   You must have the [dam-jcr-fastly:ROOT:index.adoc](#dam-jcr-fastly:ROOT:index.adoc) in your DX Cloud bundle.

-   You should be familiar with the [DAM API](../../../product-docs/7.0/Developing/API/Java-Server-APIs/DAM-API/).

## [](#_fastly_io_parameters_reference)Fastly IO parameters reference

Fastly IO allows you to apply variations to your images through query parameters. Within DX Cloud, you can configure these variations directly in the `config.yaml` file as shown in the [\[Configuration\]](#Configuration) section.

We won’t put an exhaustive list here as you can reference those directly through Fastly’s [query parameters reference documentation](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/io/#query-parameters). However, to give you an idea, here are a few common query parameters used to make variations to images.

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blur` | Applies a blur filter to the image.<br><br>For more on this parameter, see [`blur`](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/io/blur/). | `?blur=50` |
| `crop` | Crops the image to the desired parameters.<br><br>For more on this parameter, see [`crop`](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/io/crop/). | `?crop=16:9` |
| `optimize` | Applies optimal quality compression<br><br>For more on this parameter, see [`optimize`](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/io/optimize/). | `?optimize=medium` |
| `width` | Applies the desired width of the output image.<br><br>For more on this parameter, see [`width`](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/io/width/). | `?width=200` |
