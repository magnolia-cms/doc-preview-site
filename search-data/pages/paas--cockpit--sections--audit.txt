# Audit

The DX Cloud **Audit** section in the Cockpit displays Keycloak event logs.

## [](#_keycloak_event_logs)Keycloak event logs

DX Cloud stores Keycloak client event logs. Audit logs show different actions triggered by your team while they navigate and use the Cockpit. These actions range from logins to those performing backup operations.

Generally, we keep logs for **30 days**. However, for your deployment, you may configure a different duration.

> **Note:** You can select up to the last 7 days for this filter.

In addition to the guidance here, there is embedded help available directly in the Cockpit.
