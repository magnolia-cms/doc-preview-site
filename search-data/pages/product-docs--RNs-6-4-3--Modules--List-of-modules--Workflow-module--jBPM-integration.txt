It allows you to model, execute, and monitor business processes and cases throughout their life cycle. \[…​\] The core of jBPM is a light-weight, extensible workflow engine written in pure Java that allows you to execute business processes using the latest [BPMN 2.0 specification](http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/). It can run in any Java environment, embedded in your application or as a service. – [What is jBPM](https://docs.jbpm.org/7.73.0.Final/jbpm-docs/html_single/#_what_is_jbpm)
