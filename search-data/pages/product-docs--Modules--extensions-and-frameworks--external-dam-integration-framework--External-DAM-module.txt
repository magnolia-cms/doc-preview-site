# External DAM module

[Digital asset management (DAM)](../../../../use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) Unbundled: [Framework](../../../#_module_types) License: [DX Core](../../../../Administration/License/#_dx_core)\[[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")\]

> **Note:** Starting with Magnolia 6.4, the S3 integration in this module goes into maintenance mode. We recommend customers use the DAM 6.0 external binary storage implementation provided by the magnolia-dam-jcr-s3 module instead.New projects should use the DAM module for storing binaries externally and keep asset metadata in JCR. See magnolia-dam-jcr-s3 for details. See DAM module for an overview of external binary storage.The External DAM Integration Framework remains available, and the Bynder connector continues to be supported.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.external.dam</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-external-dam</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

## [](#_connection_configuration)Connection configuration

See the following pages for detailed information about connecting to and configuring your external DAM solution:

-   [AWS S3 extension configuration](../external-dam-s3-config/)

-   [Bynder extension configuration](../external-dam-bynder-config/)


Essentially, you:

-   Provide connection credentials for your external solution.

-   Enable the subapp to display in the Magnolia [Assets app](../../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Assets-app/).

-   Configure the cache if necessary.


You can create or edit the configuration in the JCR or the File System (YAML) under `<module-name>/external-dams/<definition-name>`.

Before you configure the connection, make sure you know:

-   Which solution you want to connect to. Default implementations are provided for:

    -   AWS S3

    -   Bynder


-   Connection credentials for your solution.


> **Note:** If you want to connect to another third-party tool, extend the Magnolia DAM API and create your own asset provider

> **Tip:** There are several additional DAM connector modules. For more details, see Digital asset management modules.
