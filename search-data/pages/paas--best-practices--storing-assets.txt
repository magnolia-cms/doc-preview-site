# Storing assets

This article is meant to help you better understand storing assets in PaaS.

DX Cloud leverages the Digital Asset Management (DAM) module for managing assets such as images, videos, and documents. In some cases, you may have quite a lot of assets to manage.

By default, thumbnails are disabled to ensure optimal performance in DX Cloud. Projects with a large volume of assets per folder can cause serious performance issues when thumbsnails are enabled. If you wish to turn thumbnails back on, you can do so by setting `thumbnails: true` in the [`dam.subApps.yaml` file](#dam-app:ROOT:developers/dam-app-jcr.adoc#_turning_image_thumbnails_off_in_the_asset_browser).

We only recommend doing this if you have [structured your assets](#_how_to_handle_many_assets) in an optimal way to minimize any performance degradation.

The DAM supports a large number of assets. However, if you have more than **10 000** assets, organize them into folders.

If your asset count significantly exceeds 10 000, consider integrating an external storage system using our [External DAM integration framework](../../../product-docs/7.0/Modules/extensions-and-frameworks/external-dam-integration-framework/), our [DAM API](../../../product-docs/7.0/Developing/API/Java-Server-APIs/DAM-API/), or one of our [Incubator modules](../../../incubator-modules/) extensions.

How many assets should I put in a folder?

For best performance with JCR assets, limit each folder to around 500 assets regardless of type (images, PDFs, etc.)

Use subfolders to stay organized and avoid performance issues.

-   Avoid placing too many assets in a single folder.

-   Use subfolders to improve performance and maintain structure.

We don’t recommend using publication for any assets above 2 GB. You should store anything of that size in an [external DAM system](#performance-tuning:ROOT:Image-and-media-handling/Internal-vs-external-dam.adoc#_external_dam_integration) and reference it from Magnolia.

Want to know more details about publishing assets?

When you publish an asset, it is fetched from the DB into the app server, converted from binary into a `base64` encoded stream, and zipped for transfer. Likewise, on the receiving end, it’s unzipped, decoded, and pushed from the app server to the DB. Because of that, publishing huge assets is slow and resource-intensive for both author and public servers.
