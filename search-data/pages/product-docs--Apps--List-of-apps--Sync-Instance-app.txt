# Sync Instance app

The **Sync Instance** tool allows you to manually synchronize content between an author instance and a single public instance. The operation is performed asynchronously. For more information, see the [Manual synchronization](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Synchronization-module/#_manual_synchronization) in the Synchronization module documentation.

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

The Sync Instance app is installed by the [Synchronization module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Synchronization-module/). Access to the app is restricted to the `superuser` role in the app configuration and [app launcher layout](../../../Administration/App-Launcher/App-launcher-layout/). The app is configured in `/modules/synchronization/apps/synchronization`.

| 📁 synchronization |     |

## [](#_notifications)Notifications

When defined, notifications are sent to users whenever synchronization fails.

To configure a group to send these notifications:

1.  Go to the `modules/synchronization-app/config` folder.

2.  Create a user group called `notificationGroups`.

3.  Inside that group, add a list of string properties.

    | 📁 config |     |
    | ⸬ notificationGroups |     |
    | ⬩ editors | editors |
    | ⬩ publishers | publishers |

    Each property represents a separate group of users.
