# Managing certificates

You can request an AWS certificate or import your own certificates and associate them with your environment(s) (*Live, UAT, and Integration*) via the Magnolia Cloud Cockpit.

Here, we explain how to manage certificates and associate domains to your Magnolia environments via the Cockpit.

## [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

-   You must have access to the Cockpit.

-   You must be able to set up or coordinate the DNS and domain information needed for the Cockpit.


### [](#_restricted_top_level_domains_for_public_certificates)Restricted top level domains for public certificates

The third party upon which Magnolia Cloud relies for issuing and renewing certificates have disallowed the issuance and renewal of certificates for certain domains from the **10th March, 2022** until further notice.

Restricted domains

-   `.RU`

-   `.BY`

-   `Бел` (Belarus)

-   `Рф` (Russia)

-   `.moscow`

-   `.москва`

-   `.SU`

-   `/http.ru.com` (`ru.com`)

-   `РУС`

-   `.RU.NET`


Existing certificates

All existing certificates for these domains remain functional until expiration. After expiration, however, they will not be renewable and no new certificates for these domains will be issued.

> **Tip:** You can still create a certificate with these domains by another recognised certificate authority and import it into the Cockpit.

## [](#_handle_certificates)Handle certificates

The instructions provided here detail how to request or import a certificate for the first time.

> **Important:** You cannot amend existing certificates with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).To add additional SANs:Create a new certificate.Change the association as desired.Remove the previous (now invalid) certificate.See ACM Best Practices for more information.

## [](#_handle_the_cname_record)Handle the CNAME record

After you have [requested your certificate](#_handle_certificates), be sure that you copy the `Name` and `Value` under **Configuration Information** for your *pending* certificate and add that to your DNS configuration.

> **Important:** This is needed to validate ownership of the domain.

> **Warning:** Do not remove these entries even after successful validation as they are required in order to automatically renew the certificates.

> **Note:** The procedure for adding CNAMEs depends on your DNS service provider.
