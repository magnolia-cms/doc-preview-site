# Area definition

Areas control template structure and define which parts of a template can be edited by an author. Areas are typically used on page templates, but they can also be used on components. An area definition defines what components editors can add in the area and how many. You can define areas inside your [page definitions](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Page-definition/) and [component definitions](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Component-definition/).

> **Note:** You can configure an area definition in a YAML file or a JCR node.

## [](#_where_to_define_areas)Where to define areas

Areas are defined in a [page definition](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Page-definition/) or [component definition](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Component-definition/), inside the `areas` property:

example/templates/pages/home.yaml

```js
areas:
  header:
    # header area configuration
  content:
    # content area configuration
  footer:
    # footer area configuration
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<area‑name>` | **required** Area names must be unique within a [page definition](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Page-definition/) . This means, you cannot have two areas named `column` in the same page definition but you can have `column1` and `column2` . |
| `type` | **required** , *default is `list`* Type of the area. Defines whether editors can add components inside the area and how many: • `single` can only contain one component. • `list` can contain many components. • `noComponent` cannot contain any editable components. See [Setting the area type](#_setting_the_area_type) for more details. |
| `availableComponents` | **required** for `list` and `single` areas A map of components that editors can add in the area. Reference a component by its ID: `<module>:<path>` . See [Restricting component availability in an area template](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-availability/#_restricting_component_availability_in_an_area_template) .This property is not applicable to areas of type `noComponent` . |
| `optional` | **optional** , *default is false* [FreeMarker development only](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia) Makes the area optional. `true` adds a delete button in the area toolbar that editors can use to remove the area from the page. |
| `editable` | **optional** , *default is true* Typically this property is used in reverse. By setting the value to `false` you can prevent area editing. Useful for areas like header and footer. |
| `maxComponents` | **optional** The maximum number of components an editor can add to the area. ** This is only applicable to `list` areas. | ** | This is only applicable to `list` areas. |
| ** | This is only applicable to `list` areas. |
| `enabled` | **optional** , *default is true* • If `null` , the area’s configuration inherits the values from the prototype. • If `false` , the area is not rendered, regardless of whether it contains content such as components, auto-generated content or content rendered by a script. Content is retained in the repository and will render when the area is re-enabled. • In [SPA development](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/) , if `false` , area nodes are not included in the endpoint response. ** This only applies in SPA development if the delivery endpoint type is `jcrPagesDeliveryEndpoint_v2` and Magnolia front-end helper versions are: • `1.4.2` (or higher) for `@magnolia/react-editor` • `1.5.1` (or higher) for `@magnolia/angular-editor` | ** | This only applies in SPA development if the delivery endpoint type is `jcrPagesDeliveryEndpoint_v2` and Magnolia front-end helper versions are: • `1.4.2` (or higher) for `@magnolia/react-editor` • `1.5.1` (or higher) for `@magnolia/angular-editor` |
| ** | This only applies in SPA development if the delivery endpoint type is `jcrPagesDeliveryEndpoint_v2` and Magnolia front-end helper versions are: • `1.4.2` (or higher) for `@magnolia/react-editor` • `1.5.1` (or higher) for `@magnolia/angular-editor` |
| `createAreaNode` | **optional** , *default is true* [FreeMarker development only](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia) Creates a node for the area in the repository. Set the property to `false` if an area node is not needed. See [Creating area nodes](#_creating_area_nodes) for more details. |
| `name` | **optional** , *default is the parent area item’s name* Name of the area. Identifies the area so the page can call it to be rendered. |
| `inheritance` | **optional** Inheritance renders the area’s components on child pages automatically. Inheritance saves time and effort and helps you display content consistently across the site. See [Component inheritance](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Area-definition/Component-inheritance/) for more details. |
| `autoGeneration` | **optional** Creates components inside the area automatically without editor involvement. Anything you define inside the `content` item will be generated. See [Component autogeneration](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Area-definition/Component-autogeneration/) for more details. |
| `fragmentDefinition` | **optional** (DX Core only) [FreeMarker development only](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia) Allows you to mark an area as dynamic. See [Advanced Cache](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Advanced-cache-modules/Advanced-Cache-Policies-module/) and [Sitemesh](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/High-performance-caching-modules/SiteMesh-module/) modules for more. Properties: • `class` : `info.magnolia.module.advancedcache.rendering.DynamicFragmentDefinition` ( [GitLab](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/extensions/advanced-cache/-/blob/master/magnolia-advanced-cache-dpc/src/main/java/info/magnolia/module/advancedcache/rendering/DynamicFragmentDefinition.java) ) supports an advanced definition for dynamic fragments. • `cacheKeyGeneratorClass` : Cache key generator class. *Default is null* . • `dynamic` : Enables and disables dynamic caching. *default is true* . • `mechanism` : Mechanism used. Sitemesh mechanism is supported. *Default is null* . • `ttl` : Time to live setting. *Default is 0* . |

## [](#_setting_the_area_type)Setting the area type

The `type` property determines what is rendered in the area:

-   `single` area renders a single component. You can make many components available to editors, but they can only add one. This area type works well in areas designed to grab the visitor’s attention. For example a flashy stage at the top of a home or section page, or templates designed for a specific purpose like an image gallery.

-   `list` area renders multiple components that are displayed sequentially. You can make one or more components available to editors, and by default they can add as many as they like. You can limit the number of components with the `maxComponents` property. List areas work best where you want to give editors a lot of freedom, for example in a news template. One news article may have a mix of images, text, videos, embeds and feeds, whereas another may need only text.

-   `noComponent` area does not make any components available to editors. Use this area type for content that is generated automatically, not edited. Examples include rendering content entirely by a script, code-generated content like a breadcrumb or search box, and content that is not displayed to visitors such as a meta title and description.

    > **Note:** Since version 1.0.6 of the Magnolia Front-end helpers, you can use the noComponent type in your SPA projects to create custom area scripts with as little overhead as possible.See it used in the following ReactJS example template definition: git.magnolia-cms.com/projects/MODULES/repos/frontend-helpers/browse/samples/react-sample/light-modules/react-lm/templates/pages/standard.yaml.


This example shows a minimal configuration of the three area types.

```js
areas: (1) (2)
  intro:
    type: single
    availableComponents:
      styledIntroText:
        id: my-module:components/styledIntroText
  main: (1)
    availableComponents:
      textImage:
        id: my-module:components/textImage
      blockQuote:
        id: my-module:components/blockQuote
  close:
    type: noComponent
    templateScript: /my-module/templates/misc/close.ftl
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Since `list` is the default value for the `type` property, it is not defined in the `main` area. |
| **2** | The `intro` and `main` areas don’t have a `templateScript` property. Instead, they fall back on the [Default area scripts](#_default_area_scripts). |

## [](#_editing_a_dialog_for_areas)Editing a dialog for areas

To enable the **Edit area** option on your instance, you first need to add a dialog to the area definition.

First, add an `areas` folder in `<my-module>/dialogs` (in our example `<my-module>` name is `hello-magnolia`). In this folder, you’ll create a definition file named, for example, `area-dialog.yaml` and copy the content below into it:

/hello-magnolia/dialogs/areas/area-dialog.yaml

```dialog
form:
  properties:
    text:
      label: Text
      $type: textField
footerLayout:
  $type: defaultEditorActionLayout
```

Now, go to `/hello-magnolia/templates/pages` folder, open the `hello.yaml` file and add the following to the `areas` section:

/hello-magnolia/templates/pages/hello.yaml

```dialog
areas:
  main:
    dialog: hello-magnolia:areas/area-dialog
    availableComponents:
      quotation:
        id: hello-magnolia:components/quotation
```

The **Edit area** action should be enabled now.

## [](#_default_area_scripts)Default area scripts

Even though the `templateScript` [property](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/#_common_template_properties) is required, it is not necessary to add the property to `single` and `list` area definitions. The system uses the default scripts below. If you need to render anything additional, like area `div` tags or [creating nested areas](#_creating_nested_areas), write an script and reference it in the `templateScript` property.

`single` area default script

```none
[#-- Single component area that can only contain one component --]
[#-- Area Definition should have property type=single --]
[@cms.component content=component /]
```

`list` area default script

```none
[#-- Multi component area that will list all content elements and enables adding more that one --]
[#-- Area Definition should have property type=list --]
[#list components as component]
    [@cms.component content=component /]
[/#list]
```

## [](#_creating_nested_areas)Creating nested areas

Areas can contain nested areas, which can in turn contain nested areas.

> **Warning:** If you use a nested area, you need to assign a separate template script to the parent area in which the child area is rendered.

```yml
areas:
  navigation:
    templateScript: /my-web/templates/areas/navigation.ftl
    areas:
      navigationTeaser:
        type: single
        availableComponents:
          articleTeaser:
            id: my-web:components/navigationTeaser
```

## [](#_creating_area_nodes)Creating area nodes

Area nodes are created in the JCR for each configured area by default. This is controlled by the `createAreaNode` property that is set to `true` by default.

Set the property to `false` if an area node is not needed, such as when the area type is `noComponent` or it has no content that editors could edit. Another use case for `false` is an area that operates on some other item or node’s content, not its own. When the content is stored elsewhere, no area node is needed.

```yaml
areas:
  stockExchangeTicker:
    createAreaNode: false
    templateScript: /my-module/templates/misc/stockExchangeTicker.ftl
    type: noComponent
```
