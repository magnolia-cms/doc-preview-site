# Keycloak client event logs

Keycloak client event logs provide detailed records of authentication and authorization activities within your identity and access management system. These logs help you monitor user login attempts, track security events, audit access patterns, and troubleshoot authentication issues.

Each event entry captures essential information about authentication activities, including operation types.

Keycloak events track the full authentication lifecycle, from initial login attempts through token exchanges and session management. By analyzing these logs, you can identify failed login attempts, monitor which applications users are accessing, track session durations, and detect potential security threats like brute force attacks or unauthorized access attempts.
