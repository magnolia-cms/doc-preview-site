# AI Accelerator image recognition service

The AI Accelerator image recognition service enables Magnolia to automatically tag images using multimodal large language models (LLMs). It works as a service provider for the Image Recognition module, delegating image analysis to an `AiTask` executed inside the AI Accelerator Module.

This service can detect objects, concepts, and other relevant labels in supported image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG) and return a configurable number of tags. By leveraging multimodal LLMs such as Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4o, or Anthropic Claude, it provides more context-aware and semantically rich image tagging than traditional computer vision services.

To use this service, you must [install and configure the Magnolia AI Accelerator module](../../../ai-accelerator/4.0-alpha/), then follow the instructions on this page.

INFO: When you use the AI Accelerator image recognition service, assets are sent to the external AI provider for processing. Check your provider’s terms to understand how submitted images may be stored, used, or repurposed. Some providers may use images to train their own models.

## [](#_set_the_service_provider)Set the service provider

Configure the service provider class in `/image-recognition/config.yaml`:

/image-recognition/config.yaml

```yaml
currentService: info.magnolia.ai.image.accelerator.AiAcceleratorImageRecogniser (1)
```

<1>The class name of the service to be used for image recognition. Use `info.magnolia.ai.image.accelerator.AiAcceleratorImageRecogniser`. Default is `info.magnolia.ai.image.ImageRecogniser$Noop`.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `aiTaskId` | **required** *default is ai-accelerator-image-recognition:tagImageWithLLM* `AiTask` to be executed for image recognition. ** Only change this if you provide a custom `AiTask` implementation. For most cases, decorating the configuration of the default task is sufficient. | ** | Only change this if you provide a custom `AiTask` implementation.

| ** | Only change this if you provide a custom `AiTask` implementation. For most cases, decorating the configuration of the default task is sufficient. |
| `maxLabels` | **required,** *default is 10* The maximum number of tags you want the recognition service to return. This is an integer and the minimum value is `0` . ** If set to 0, no tags are assigned to an image asset. | ** | If set to 0, no tags are assigned to an image asset. |
| ** | If set to 0, no tags are assigned to an image asset. |
| `supportedFormats` | **required,** *default is png, jpg, jpeg* A list of image formats defining which image types are automatically recognized by the image recognition service. ** Check the capabilities of your configured model. | ** | Check the capabilities of your configured model. |
| ** | Check the capabilities of your configured model. |
| `maxWidth` | **required,** *default is 256* Images sent to the multimodal LLM will be resized to the given size. LLMs typically don’t need high resolution images and lowering the resolution reduces number of used tokens and therefore token cost. |
