# Getting Magnolia

Hello Magnolia

For development and testing, you need a running [instance](../../../Administration/Instances/) of Magnolia. In this tutorial, we suppose it is installed in a directory called `magnolia`.

If you don’t have Magnolia installed and running, go to the page called [Installing Magnolia through npm CLI](../../Installing-Magnolia/Installing-Magnolia-through-npm-CLI/) and complete the steps described there.

Once you’ve done that, come back to Hello Magnolia and continue by [creating the light module](../Create-light-module/).
