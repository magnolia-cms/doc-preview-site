# Developing a custom pages app

This page describes how to develop a custom pages app whose features are similar to the Magnolia [Pages app](../../List-of-apps/Pages-app/) but is tailored to the needs of your project, for example to:

-   Provide a custom action to create a page that is linked to some external content.

-   Store the content in a custom workspace and with a custom node type.


> **Note:** Currently, it is not possible to create a custom pages app with Magnolia Light Development alone. A custom Java module is required.

## [](#_introduction)Introduction

You can provision the Page Editor UI in any app, creating a more powerful and intuitive Magnolia for you Authoring team(s).

Authors may want to use the Page Editor UI in other apps besides the Pages app. For example, to create:

-   a **Mobile** or **Kiosk** apps, to allow editing of multiple channels.

-   a **Reusables** app, to allow creation of parts of pages which could be reused in many pages.


This is supported in both the FreeMarker and the headless modes.

## [](#_example)Example

Follow these steps to try the demonstration which will create a custom pages app which utilizes a custom `workspace` and `nodeType`.

1.  Clone the [custom-pages-app-barebones]({repo-customPagesAppBarebones}) repository.

2.  Execute the `mgnl jumpstart` command and in the two templates lists displayed consecutively, select the `demo-webapp` and `magnolia-community-demo-webapp` templates.

3.  Build the module (a) and copy the jar file into the webapp (b):

    1.  `cd custom-pages-support && mvn clean install && cd ..`

    2.  `cp custom-pages-support/target/custom-pages-support-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar apache-tomcat/webapps/magnoliaAuthor/WEB-INF/lib/`


4.  Run `mgnl start`.

5.  Run the React application:

    1.  `cd spa/spa-react-app`

    2.  `npm install && npm run start`


6.  In the Security app, assign permissions to the `rest-anonymous` user role.

    1.  On the Access control lists tab, set `CustomWebsite` to `Read Only` for the `/` path.

    2.  On the Web access tab, assign the `Get` method to the `/.rest/annotations/*` path.



### [](#_sample_custom_pages_app)Sample custom pages app

For reference, see the code example of a custom pages app:

```sh
git clone {repo-git-customPagesAppBarebones}
```

## [](#_implementation_tips)Implementation tips

-   The `workspace` and `nodeType` are registered through the `contentType`. See `/light-modules/custom-pages-app-lm/contentTypes/customPages.yaml` in the cloned repository.

-   The new template annotation (`/light-modules/custom-pages-app-lm/restEndpoints/annotations/`) and delivery (`/light-modules/custom-pages-app-lm/restEndpoints/delivery/`) endpoints now target the custom workspace.

    The SPA is updated to use this custom annotations endpoint. See `spa/spa-react-app/src/environment.js`.


> **Caution:** Some classes that are required are only component-mapped for the pages-app. To re-use them in the custom Pages app, they must be mapped manually at the moment.Bear in mind that the id is hard-coded, so the name of the custom pages app needs to be custom-pages-app.See the module descriptor.The Add page action must define the custom createPage dialog in order to create pages with the custom nodeType.
