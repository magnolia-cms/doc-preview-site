# Monitoring

Monitoring is a process that detects, diagnoses, remedies and reports an application’s performance and availability to ensure that it meets user expectations. Magnolia provides built-in tools for logging and debugging application behavior. It also supports Java Management Extensions (JMX), a Java technology for managing and monitoring. These mechanisms provide developers, administrators and especially the support team detailed context for application failures.

| Type | Location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `log4j2.xml` | `/WEB-INF/config/default` | A permanent configuration which persists restarts. In the XML file you can also choose whether you wish to log a [Class or package](#_class_or_package) . Any changes made to the file will require a restart of the server. |
| Log Tools app | Tools menu | A transient configuration which resets after a restart. In the [Log Tools app](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Log-Tools-app/) you can choose whether you wish to log a Class or package. Any changes made in the app are active immediately. This tool is useful for ad-hoc debugging of production issues since you don’t need to restart Magnolia to turn it on. |
| Audit Logging | `/server/auditLogging` | [Audit logging](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Monitoring/Audit/) means tracking user activity in the system such as who signed in and what they did. Here you select the actions you want to audit such as login, create, publish and so on. |

## [](#_capturing_request_and_response_headers)Capturing request and response headers

Request and response headers are information passed between a browser and a web server. Headers consist of [fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields) that define the operating parameters of the HTTP transaction. Capturing the headers tells you what records are passed and provides a clue for troubleshooting.

The request header contains details of what the browser wants and what it will accept back from the server. It also contains the type, version and capabilities of the browser so that the server returns compatible data.

Example: Request header

```none
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8) AppleWebKit/534.50 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.1 Safari/534.50
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml-xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Referer: http://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/demo-project.html
Cache-Control: max-age=0
```

The response header contains the date, size and type of file that the server is sending back to the client and data about the server itself. The header is attached to the files being sent back to the client.

Example: Response header

```none
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 2011 11:09:41 GMT
Content-Encoding: gzip
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Length: 3229
Pragma: no-cache

Last-Modified: Thu, 13 Oct 2011 11:01:26 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Ubuntu)
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100
Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
```

### [](#_browser_extensions)Browser extensions

To capture the headers, you can use a browser extension or plugin that displays headers for the currently open page. A plugin’s advantage over a [Websites](#_websites) is that you can also use it for sites that only exist in your local environment or intranet.

-   Safari: [Developer Tools](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/safari/developer-tools)

-   Firefox: [Web Developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/) or [Live HTTP Headers](http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/) add-on

-   Chrome: [Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview)

-   Internet Explorer: [Fiddler](http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/)


To view headers in Developer Tools:

1.  Open Developer Tools.

2.  Go to **Network**.

3.  Reload the page.

4.  Select the page in the list.

5.  Go to **Headers** tab.


### [](#_command_line_tools)Command line tools

Any Unix-like system likely has these command line tools already installed.

-   [cURL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL)
    `$ curl --head <url>`

-   [wget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget)
    `$ wget --server-response <url>`


### [](#_applications)Applications

Rich client applications:

-   [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/). See [Capturing HTTP traffic](http://wiki.wireshark.org/Hyper_Text_Transfer_Protocol).


### [](#_websites)Websites

A header-sniffing website can report headers for a site that resides on the public Internet. These tools do not work for a site that exists only in your local environment.
