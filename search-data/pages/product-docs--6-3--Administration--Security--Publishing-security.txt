# Publishing security

[Publishing](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Publishing/) of content from author to public instances is authenticated using [public-key cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). Public-key cryptography is a system that requires two separate keys: a public key to lock or encrypt the plain text request and a private key to unlock or decrypt the cyphertext request. Neither key can do both and neither is derivable from knowledge of the other. One is published and the other is kept private.

On receiving a publishing request, a Magnolia public instance authenticates the author instance using a public key. The author instance generates the key automatically on first publishing of content and transfers it to the public instance. You can [generate new public keys](#_generating_a_new_public_key) any time on the author instance. A single public key is used for multiple public instances.

## [](#_generating_a_new_public_key)Generating a new public key

You can create a new public key in the [Publishing Tools app](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Publishing-Tools-app/). A longer key means better security, but publications can take longer. The shortest key length already meets the standard security requirements.

To generate a new public key:

1.  On the author instance, open the Publishing Tools app.

2.  Click **Generate new key**. This generates a new public key and registers it automatically on the author instance.

3.  Copy the new key from the **Current public key** box.

4.  Sign in to the public instances and open the Configuration app.

5.  Paste the key to **Configuration >** `/server/activation/publicKey`.


Copy the newly generated public key to all public instances. It’s not transferred automatically on publishing as is the case with the initial key. You can’t activate the `publicKey` node to the public instance as at this point because a mismatch exists between the keys on author and public.

## [](#_troubleshooting)Troubleshooting

Any type of misconfiguration related either to the keys themselves or the handshaking process between the author and the public instance(s) may lead to [publishing errors](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Troubleshooting/Publishing-issues/).
