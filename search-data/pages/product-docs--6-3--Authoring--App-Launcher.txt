Many apps exist in Magnolia and the App Launcher helps you find what you need quickly, saving time and making content creation easier. For authors especially, the App Launcher layout and the Favorite apps section bring the apps you regularly use to your fingertips without having to scroll up and down looking for them, separating apps into color-coded areas according to whether they’re used for authoring or development.

The App Launcher page is shown after login and can be reached at any time by clicking on the App Launcher icon ![App Launcher icon](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/mgnl-app-launcher.png).
