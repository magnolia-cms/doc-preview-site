# Adding the component to the page

Hello Magnolia

Now, a content author can add a quotation component to the `hello` page with the text and the author of a quotation.

1.  Open the `hello` page in the Pages app.

2.  Click the **New Main Component** + button.

3.  Add the quotation component and click **Next**.

4.  Enter your favorite quotation in the dialog and **Save changes**.

5.  Click **Preview page** and then publish it.

Finally, access the web page on the public instance: [localhost:8080/magnoliaPublic/hello.html](http://localhost:8080/magnoliaPublic/hello.html). ![Final page view](../../../_images/helloPage_final.png)

Other editors, with appropriate permissions configured in the [Security app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/), can now also change the content of the quotation component on the Author instance.

Congratulations!

You now know the basics of Magnolia templating. With these techniques, you can build websites where non-technical authors can manage content using dialogs.
