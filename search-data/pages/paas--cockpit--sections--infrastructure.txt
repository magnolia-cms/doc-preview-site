# Infrastructure

DX Cloud runs on Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes clusters are sets of node machines running containerized applications. One of the primary advantages of Kubernetes clusters is that they automatically manage your cluster to match the configured desired state.

> **Tip:** Check out the subsections below to get an idea of what the Cockpit displays for you regarding Clusters.

## [](#_kubernetes_flow)Kubernetes flow

Let’s say you deploy your application with the desired state of having `4 nodes` of your application running. If 1 of the nodes crashes, we see just 3 nodes are active, so we add 1 more to meet the desired state.

## [](#_select_desired_cluster)Select desired cluster

Select your desired cluster from the dropdown menu at the top of the Cockpit.

![select cluster id](../../_images/select-cluster-id.jpg)

## [](#_overview)Overview

The Infrastructure **Overview** section in the Cockpit displays information about the clusters you have available in your DX Cloud setup. There are typically production and integration clusters at a minimum, but each setup is different.

![clusters overview](../../_images/clusters/clusters-overview.jpg)

### [](#_what_info_is_displayed)What info is displayed?

The overview displays the following information:

-   Cloud provider (such as `rke` standing for Rancher Kubernetes)

-   Number of nodes

-   When the cluster was created

-   The current endpoint exposed by the load balancer


There is also a table that shows detailed node information such as:

-   Name (the name of the node)

-   Location of the node

-   Node type

-   Version

-   External IP

-   Architecture

-   Operating System (OS)

-   CPU usage in percentage

-   Memory usage in percentage

-   When the node was created


> **Tip:** If you want to see all resources (not just Magnolia), click Show all resources. This then shows all pods in the node.

## [](#_real_time_usage)Real time usage

The Real time usage section displays real-time CPU and memory usage for each node in your cluster. It lets you monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation effectively, providing valuable insights to better understand and manage your infrastructure.

### [](#_cpu_usage_per_node)CPU usage per node

The Infrastructure **CPU usage per node** in the Cockpit displays information about CPUs for your DX Cloud project. It shows you how much CPU is used per node over the specified time. Hover over the chart for details or click and drag to focus on a more focused period of time.

### [](#_memory_usage_per_node)Memory usage per node

The Infrastructure **Memory usage per node** in the Cockpit displays information about memory for your DX Cloud project. It shows you how much memory is used per node over the specified time. Hover over the chart for details or click and drag to focus on a more focused period of time.
