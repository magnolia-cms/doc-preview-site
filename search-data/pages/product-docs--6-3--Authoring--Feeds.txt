# Feeds

The RSS Aggregator module displays external feed content on a Magnolia page (feed aggregation) and generates feeds from Magnolia content (feed syndication).

Planet feeds enhance standard aggregation feeds by collecting additional data and generating feed statics.

## [](#_creating_an_aggregate_feed)Creating an aggregate feed

A feed aggregator retrieves external feeds and displays the content on a Magnolia page.

[Planet feeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_%28software%29) have all the features of standard feeds but can generate additional data and statistics that is displayed in planet components. See [Feed components](#_feed_components) and for more details.

In this example we collect three individual RSS feeds into one aggregate feed:

-   Slashdot: [http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot](http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot)

-   Engadget: [http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml](http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml)


These have a common topic – technology – so they are good candidates for aggregation. A reader interested in one feed is likely to be interested in the others too.

To create a RSS aggregator, in the Feeds app:

1.  Add a new feed.

    -   **Name**: `Technology`. This is the internal name of the aggregator.

    -   **Title**: Feed title.

    -   **Short description**: Feed description.

    -   Check **Planet Feed** to mark the feed as a planet feed.


2.  Add the feed URLs from above.

    -   **Title**: Leave blank to get the title from the external feed title

    -   **URL**: Feed URL.
        **Image**: Select an image from the DAM. 60x60 px works best. The image is displayed in the Planet Feeds component. [Hackergotchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackergotchi) images are supported.


3.  Add filters to refine content.

    1.  **Condition**: Select an AND, OR or NOT condition to include or exclude content.

    2.  **Property**: Select from a pre-defined list of options, Author, Category, Description or Title, commonly found in feeds.

    3.  **Regex**: Type a [regex pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to meet the condition and property in the first two boxes.

Feeds can be marked as a planet feed at any time. When you change a standard feed to a planet feed, [re-import the feed data](#_importing_feed_data) before generating planet data.

## [](#_importing_feed_data)Importing feed data

To import data:

-   All feeds: Click **Import all feeds** **now**.

-   A single feed: Click **Import feed** **now**.


See also: [Scheduling automated feed imports](#_scheduling_automated_feed_imports).

## [](#_feed_components)Feed components

The module includes components that display external feeds and generate feeds from internal content.

Content will only display in the feed components after it has been [imported](#_importing_feed_data). To display feed content on the public instance publish the feed in the Feeds app. This will also publish the feed data.

Read more about configuring feed components over [here](../../Administration/Authoring-content-config/Feed-component-configuration/).

## [](#_scheduling_automated_feed_imports)Scheduling automated feed imports

[Importing feed data manually](#_importing_feed_data) is not a long-term solution. You should configure an automated import schedule. Choose the update frequency depending on how often feeds have new content. For example, if a blog gets one post a day then importing once a day at 6 a.m. is enough.

### [](#_setting_automated_imports_for_all_feeds)Setting automated imports for all feeds

You can schedule automated imports for all feeds in the Configuration app. The global settings can be [overridden](_setting_automated_imports_for_single_feeds) for single feeds.

1.  **Periodic import**:

    1.  **Disabled**: Automated imports are disabled by default. You can switch off them off at any time.

    2.  **Import every**: Quick option to set imports for a specified number of minutes, hours or days.

    3.  **Use cron time/date defintion**: Define a [Quartz Cron Pattern](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/docs/tutorials/crontrigger.html) to create a suitable import schedule.

        For example, the pattern `0 0 6 * * *` imports data daily at 6 a.m. See [Cron Maker](http://www.cronmaker.com/) for help.


2.  **Fetcher**: Substitute the default feed fetcher class if necessary.

Head over [here](../../Administration/Authoring-content-config/Feed-component-configuration/#_configuring_automated_reports) to read more about configuring automated imports for all feeds.

### [](#_setting_automated_imports_for_single_feeds)Setting automated imports for single feeds

You can configure automated import settings for each feed in the Import Settings tab of the edit dialog.

> **Caution:** These setting override the global settings.

1.  **Periodic import**:

    1.  Select **This feed has different import settings** to override the global settings.

    2.  **Disabled**: Stops any scheduled automated imports for the individual feed and the global settings take over.

    3.  **Import every**: Quick option to set imports for a specified number of minutes, hours or days.

    4.  **Use cron time/date defintion**: Define a [Quartz Cron Pattern](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/docs/tutorials/crontrigger.html) to create a suitable import schedule.

        For example, the pattern `0 0 6 * * *` imports data daily at 6 a.m. See [Cron Maker](http://www.cronmaker.com/) for help.


2.  **Fetcher**: Substitute the default feed fetcher class if necessary.
