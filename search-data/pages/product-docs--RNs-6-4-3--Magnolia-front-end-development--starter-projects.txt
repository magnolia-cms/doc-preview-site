# Starter projects

The *Magnolia Starter Projects* give developers consistent and structured starting points for building projects with Magnolia, whether using headless SPA frameworks or FreeMarker templating. We call them `starters`.

Whether you’re building a single-page application, a server-side rendered app, or a FreeMarker-based site, you can now see how to integrate with Magnolia’s most popular features using the technology that best suits your project.

You don’t have to start with a Starter Project. You can begin with your own project and use the starters as examples of how certain features can be implemented.

## [](#_features)Features

Each demo provides insights into how Magnolia works with different technologies, from modern front-end frameworks to FreeMarker templating. They include working examples of the key content management tasks in the visual editor. They also showcase advanced features like:

-   Component auto-generation

-   Inheritance

-   Internationalization (i18n)

-   Personalization (p13n)


Whether you’re experimenting with Magnolia integration or using them as a starting point, the `starters` offer a solid foundation.

They’re compatible with both the Magnolia Community Edition and Magnolia DX Core.

### [](#_sdk_v1)SDK v1

While the headless SPA starter projects described above are the recommended starting place, they use the **v2** of the [Magnolia front-end SDK](../../Developing/headless/spa-development/magnolia-front-end-sdk/).

If you’re using **v1** of the SDK (known previously as the *Magnolia front-end helpers*), you may want to use the older generation of the headless SPA starters known as the *Minimal Headless SPA Demos*. You can find them all in a single Bitbucket repository:

-   [`minimal-headless-spa-demos`](https://bitbucket.org/magnolia-cms/minimal-headless-spa-demos/src/master/)


## [](#_jumpstarting_the_projects)Jumpstarting the projects

To get a complete project integrated with Magnolia content editing, use the Magnolia CLI ([Installing CLI](../../../../magnolia-cli/getting-started/#_installing_cli)).

In a terminal, jumpstart your project by executing the CLI `jumpstart` command:

```console
npx @magnolia/cli@latest jumpstart
```
