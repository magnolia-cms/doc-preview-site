# Action definition

Action definitions configure actions in the UI. They are used in apps, forms and dialogs. The action name is the definition content node name.

Each action has an action definition class that implements the info.magnolia.ui.api.action.ActionDefinition interface. Some [definition classes](#_general_action_definition_classes) allow for additional properties and call more classes to execute logic.

> **Tip:** You can reuse existing Magnolia actions in your own app. Many actions are so basic that you can just copy their definitions. For actions that have their own properties, you may need to set the properties for the actions to work.

> **Note:** These action definitions are part of the Magnolia 6 UI framework.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<action name>` | **required** Name of the action. The name is used in [action bar definition](../Action-bar-definition/) . |
| `class` | **required** (unless `$type` is used) [Action definition class](#_general_action_definition_classes) that reads the configuration properties and can supply additional properties to the action. The class must implement the info.magnolia.ui.api.action.ActionDefinition interface. Set the value to the fully qualified class name. |
| `$type` | You can use this as a shortcut for `class` if the definition class is annotated with `info.magnolia.ui.api.action.ActionType` . The proper value is defined by the annotation. Example class annotation `@ActionType("addNodeAction") public class AddNodeActionDefinition extends ConfiguredActionDefinition { ... }` To use the `$type` property in YAML, see [General actions](#_general_actions) . |
| `label` | **required** Label displayed to users in the action bar or context menu. |
| `implementationClass` | **required** Implementation class that executes the action. A default implementation class is typically hard-coded in the definition class. You only need to add this property if you want to override the default implementation. ** You can’t configure this property through YAML but it can be used in your Java code. | ** | You can’t configure this property through YAML but it can be used in your Java code. |
| ** | You can’t configure this property through YAML but it can be used in your Java code. |
| `icon` | **optional** CSS class that identifies an icon used for the action. For available names, see [Icons](../../Developing-an-app/General-aspects/Designing-an-app/Icons/) . |
| `availability` | **optional** Defines whether the action is permitted on the selected item. ** For more information, see [Action availability](#_action_availability) . | ** | For more information, see [Action availability](#_action_availability) . |
| ** | For more information, see [Action availability](#_action_availability) . |
| []() `datasourceRefreshBehavior` | **optional** , *default is all* Defines the default behavior for when the datasource is refreshed. By default, the entire datasource is refreshed when an action is performed. To improve performance for actions where some items are just modified (not created or deleted), set the property to `items` so that only modified items are refreshed after an action is performed. |

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<action name>` | **required** Name of the action. |
| `command` | **required** Name of the command. |
| `catalog` | **optional** , *default is default* Name of the [catalog](../../../Developing/Commands/#_catalogs) where the command resides. You only need this property if you implement a command that has the same name as an existing command such as `publish` . |
| `asynchronous` | **optional** , *default is false* Runs a command asynchronously in the background, which is useful for long-running actions. To run a command asynchronously, set the property to `true` . ** For more information, see [Asynchronous actions](#_asynchronous_actions) . | ** | For more information, see [Asynchronous actions](#_asynchronous_actions) . |
| ** | For more information, see [Asynchronous actions](#_asynchronous_actions) . |

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<action name>` | **required** Name of the action. |
| `availability` | **required** Defines the availability configuration for the action. |
| `access` | **optional** Action is available if the current user has one of the listed roles. |
| `roles` | **required** Action is available to users assigned the list of [roles](../../../Administration/IAM/Roles-and-access-control-lists/) . |
| `<role>` | **required** Name of the [role](../../../Administration/IAM/Roles-and-access-control-lists/) that is permitted to execute the action. Add one property for each role. |
| `nodes` | **optional** , *default is true* Action is available if the selected item is a node. |
| `nodeTypes` | **optional** Action is available if the selected item is one of the node types listed. |
| `<node type>` | **required** Valid [node type](../../../Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) such as `mgnl:folder` . |
| `rules` | **optional** Action is available if the selected item matches every availability rule class. |
| `<rule name>` | **required** It gives the node a name that describes the rule class. One node for each rule, and the node name is arbitrary. |
| `class` | **required** (unless `$type` is used) [Action availability definition class](#_action_availability_definition_classes) . The class must implement the info.magnolia.ui.api.availability.AvailabilityDefinition interface. Set the value to the fully qualified class name. |
| `$type` | You can use this as a shortcut for `class` if the definition class is annotated with info.magnolia.ui.api.availability.AvailabilityRuleType . The proper value is defined by the annotation. |
| `implementationClass` | **required** The class that contains custom logic to check if the action is permitted on the selected item and implements info.magnolia.ui.availability.rule.AvailabilityRule . Your custom class must extend info.magnolia.ui.availability.rule.AbstractAvailabilityRule . A default implementation class is typically hard-coded in the definition class. You only need to add this property if you want to override the default implementation. |
| `root` | **optional** Action is available at the workspace root level if `true` . |
| `folder` | **optional** , *default is null* Action is available for folders only if `true` , and for non-folder content only if `false` . When this property is not specified, the action is available for both folders and non-folder content. ** This option is for CDS content and is not supported for JCR content. Please see the [nodeTypes](../../../Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) option and use `mgnl:folder` node type to specify availability for folders in JCR. | ** | This option is for CDS content and is not supported for JCR content. Please see the [nodeTypes](../../../Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) option and use `mgnl:folder` node type to specify availability for folders in JCR. |
| ** | This option is for CDS content and is not supported for JCR content. Please see the [nodeTypes](../../../Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) option and use `mgnl:folder` node type to specify availability for folders in JCR. |
| `properties` | **optional** , *default is false* Action is available if the selected item is a property. |
| `multiple` | **optional** , *default is false* Defines whether the action is available for multiple items. For more information, see [Actions on multiple items](#_actions_on_multiple_items) . |
| `writePermissionRequired` | **optional** , *default is false* Set to `true` if the action requires write permission on the currently selected node. The action will be disabled if the user does not have write permission. |
