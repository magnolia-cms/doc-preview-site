# Use AI-assisted text fields

**Available from version `1.1.1`**

Enhance existing or new text fields with AI-driven tools to assist users in editing or generating text interactively. Transform standard text fields into AI-enhanced ones, offering extensions like summarizing, expanding, or changing tone for flexible content refinement.

AI-powered forms feature allows developers to easily transform any existing text fields in a Magnolia dialog into AI enhanced text fields. Use the AI-assisted text field in your forms or turn `textField` into an AI-powered `textField`.

Recap

-   **Use case**: Best for user-driven content editing, where the AI suggests improvements or generates text based on user interaction.

-   **Example**: A title field where the user can summarize or expand text with a click, with a max length of 150 characters.
