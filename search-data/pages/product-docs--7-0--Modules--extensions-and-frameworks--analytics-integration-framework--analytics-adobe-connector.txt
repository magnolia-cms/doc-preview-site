# Adobe Analytics extension

Once you have [installed the analytics integration framework](../Analytics-module/), you must connect to your data supplier. This page describes how to connect to a Adobe Analytics data supplier.

You must have an appropriate account and credentials to connect to Adobe Analytics.

## [](#_licensing)Licensing

The associated framework is included with your DX Core license and is free of charge. However, this extension is paid and requires an additional [special license](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/License/).
