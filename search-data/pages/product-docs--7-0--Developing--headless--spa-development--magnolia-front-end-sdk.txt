# Magnolia front-end SDK

> **Note:** Learn what’s new and changed in the Frontend SDK v2.Magnolia front-end helpers version 2.0.0 has been released. However, most of this page’s information and subpages still refer to version 1.0.0.We’re actively working on updating these pages for the latest version.

Magnolia front-end helpers is a collection of JavaScript libraries that enable easy integration of single-page applications in the Magnolia Pages app.

Magnolia provides the following helper libraries:

-   Angular editor

-   React editor

-   Vue editor

-   Magnolia Template Annotations (For usage with the v1 libraries.)

-   Frontend Helpers Base (For usage with the v2 libraries.)


The annotations make content from a front-end project editable in Magnolia. This is achieved by injecting annotations (HTML comments) around components which the Magnolia Page editor transforms into controls for web content editors.

> **Note:** The original name of this page was Magnolia front-end helpers for SPA. We’ve decided to rename it to Magnolia front-end SDK to match it with the broader scope and functionality of the v2 helper libraries.

## [](#_supported_magnolia_releases)Supported Magnolia releases

The Frontend SDK v2 framework is compatible with any Magnolia 6.4 or 6.3 release.

As regards the older Magnolia 6.2 branch, you can use the FE SDK v2 with any release since Magnolia 6.2.45 (May 15, 2024).

## [](#_supported_framework_versions)Supported framework versions

Our policy is to use the oldest LTS versions (or oldest versions with security support) of the frameworks in our frontend libraries. This ensures that projects that use the older versions are still supported.

As to our sample projects, we aim to use the latest active versions of the frameworks to make sure that our libraries are forward-compatible.

-   **Angular**

    -   The `angular-editor` can use **[the oldest version of the LTS release](https://angular.io/guide/releases#actively-supported-versions)**.

    -   Projects can be built with that one or any later version of Angular.

    -   Our `angular-sample` uses the current active version, which is ![Angular framework version - current active version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/angular/angular?style=flat-square&logo=appveyor).


-   **React**

    -   The `react-editor` uses **the oldest version with security support**, currently [version `16`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#16140-october-14-2020).

    -   Projects can be built with that one or any later version of React.

    -   Our `react-sample` uses the latest version, which is ![React framework version - the latest version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react.svg?style=flat-square).


-   **Vue**

    -   The `vue-editor` uses **the current active version**, which is ![Vue framework version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/vuejs/core?style=flat-square&logo=appveyor).

    -   Projects can be built with version `3` of Vue. Older versions such as `vue2` are not supported.



## [](#_nodejs_versions)NodeJS versions

For compilation of libraries and testing the samples, we use [the latest LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download) of NodeJS.

## [](#_java_versions)Java versions

To see which Java versions you can use for your Magnolia instances, please see [the Java section on our Certified stack page](../../../../Administration/Certified-stack/#_java).

## [](#_installing)Installing

You can add the libraries to your JavaScript project by installing them as project dependencies. The libraries have the following npm package names:

-   [`@magnolia/angular-editor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magnolia/angular-editor) ![angular editor](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@magnolia/angular-editor.svg?style=flat-square&logo=appveyor)
