# Locale

This page provides a brief overview of:

-   What is locale?

-   Which locale parameters are directly configurable in Magnolia.


## [](#_what_is_locale)What is locale

Generally speaking, a locale in computing is \`\`a set of parameters that defines the user’s language, region and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface'' (Wikipedia).

Locale is more often associated with the language parameter, which is usually defined by a two-, three- or four-letter language code, standardized under [ISO 639](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html). See the [IANA Language Subtag Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) for a complete list of available language codes and language variants.

Nevertheless, the set of locale parameters is much broader than just the parameter for language. Any operation that requires a locale to perform its task is *locale-sensitive*. For example, even displaying a number may be a locale-sensitive operation: the number should be formatted according to the conventions of the user’s native country, region, or culture.

## [](#_locale_sensitive_parameters)Locale-sensitive parameters

The following is a list of the most common parameters that one should be aware of when implementing a locale-sensitive operation:

-   **Language**

    -   For instance, British English: `en-GB` vs American English: `en-US`.

    -   See the [AdminCentral and public locales](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Language/AdminCentral-and-public-locales/) page for configuration in Magnolia and [java.util.Locale](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html).


-   **Time zone**

    -   Nine standard time zones in the USA, for example.

    -   See the [Time zone](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Locale/Time-zone/) subpage and [java.util.TimeZone](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html).


-   **Date-time format**

    -   UK: `14 March 2016` vs US: `March 14, 2016`. For details see [java.text.DateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/DateFormat.html).


-   **Number format**

    -   English: `3.14` vs Czech: `3,14`, for details see [java.text.NumberFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/NumberFormat.html).


-   **Paper size**

    -   US, Canada and other countries: `ANSI Letter` vs `ISO A4` in many other nations.


-   **Currency format**

    -   Please refer to [Currency codes - ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), listing currency codes used in banking and business globally.
