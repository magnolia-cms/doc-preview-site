# Content structure and publishing

## [](#_overview)Overview

This section covers Magnolia CMS structure, focusing on optimizing the use of Apache Jackrabbit as the repository implementation. It also covers ways to improve publishing performance, the Synchronization module for selective content publishing, and best practices for structuring a JCR workspace to avoid performance issues.

Tuning tips - Content structure and publishing

-   **Repositories and workspaces**

    -   The JCR standard API is used for content repositories. Don’t change data by bypassing the API, as this can cause integrity issues.

        For more, see [JCR standard API for content repositories](Content-storage-and-structure/#_jcr_standard_api_for_content_repositories).

    -   Best practices for structuring JCR workspaces:

        -   Limit child nodes to under 500 for any parent node.

        -   Use time-related content folder structures (for example, `/<year>/<month>/<category>/<page>`).

            For more, see [Structuring your JCR workspace](Structuring-jcr-workspace/).



-   **Optimizing publishing performance**

    -   Publishing pages separately.

    -   Using `itemsPerRequest` to reduce publication requests.

    -   Optimizing ordering on the public instance.

    -   Optimizing dead nodes in PostgreSQL.

        For more, see [Publishing performance](Publishing-performance/).


-   **Optimizing publishing and related actions**

    -   Using the command property `asynchronous` to avoid waiting times for actions, such as delete, publish, unpublish, duplicate, and import, when handling large data volumes.

        For more, see [Asynchronous actions](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/App-configuration/Action-definition/#_asynchronous_actions).


-   **Swift publishing**

    -   Scale publishing efficiently using the Swift publishing module.

        For more, see [Swift publication](Internal-vs-external-publication/#_swift_publication).
