# BOM for third-party libraries

> A software bill of materials (software BOM) is a list of components in a piece of software. Software vendors often create products by assembling open source and commercial software components. The software BOM describes the components in a product. It is analogous to a list of ingredients on food packaging. (Wikipedia)

## [](#_bom_in_magnolia)BOM in Magnolia

As an option, you may use a special BOM project to centralize dependencies for third-party libraries instead of managing them in the `magnolia-main` module and some other modules such as `magnolia-ui` and `rest`. This third-party BOM project is a plain Maven POM project whose only responsibility is to manage the versions of third-party dependencies in POM file such as `magnolia-external-dependencies-6.2.pom`.

To use a BOM in your project, include the following snippet as the very first dependency in the `dependencyManagement` section of the parent poms and adjust the `version` number accordingly.

```xml
  <dependency>
   <groupId>info.magnolia.boms</groupId>
   <artifactId>magnolia-external-dependencies</artifactId>
   <version>6.2</version>
   <type>pom</type>
   <scope>import</scope>
  </dependency>
```

For the `version` number, use the latest version released for this branch.

> **Important:** Currently it is 6.3.20.

If you use the `magnolia-main` parent (`info.magnolia:magnolia-project`) to manage the third-party dependencies as well, we recommend that you use our third-party BOM for this in the future. You can apply the change at any time you want.

Example of the `dependencyManagement` section:

```xml
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <!-- 3rd-party BOM -->
      <dependency>
        <groupId>info.magnolia.boms</groupId>
        <artifactId>magnolia-external-dependencies</artifactId>
        <version>6.2</version>
        <scope>import</scope>
        <type>pom</type>
      </dependency>

      <!-- Module BOM -->
      <dependency>
        <groupId>info.magnolia.dx</groupId>
        <artifactId>magnolia-dx-core-parent</artifactId>
        <version>6.2</version>
        <scope>import</scope>
        <type>pom</type>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
```

**Best practice**

The second dependency is usually a Magnolia parent POM (CE or DX Core) which functions as a Magnolia module BOM that manages all module versions in a particular release.

## [](#_3rd_party_libraries_list)3rd-party libraries list

A list of licenses of third-party libraries used by Magnolia as part of the build is displayed in the **Libraries license info** tab of the About app.

On Magnolia Cloud, there is no other option to get an overview of these libraries and their licenses.
