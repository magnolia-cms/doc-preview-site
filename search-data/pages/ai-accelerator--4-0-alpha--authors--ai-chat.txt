# Smart Chat

Smart Chat is a conversational AI assistant integrated into Magnolia CMS that helps content authors with everyday tasks. It provides a chat interface where you can ask questions, request assistance, and automate repetitive tasks using natural language.

## [](#_how_it_works)How it works

Smart Chat uses a large language model (LLM) to understand your requests and respond in natural language. It has access to *tools* that allow it to:

-   Display information in structured formats (tables, lists)

-   Navigate to different apps in Magnolia

-   Perform content operations

-   Generate images and other content


Smart Chat is *context-aware*. That means it knows which app you’re currently in and what content you have selected. This allows it to provide more relevant assistance based on your current location.

> **Note:** Smart Chat operates within your assigned Magnolia security roles. It can only access tools, apps, and content that you have explicit permission to use.

## [](#_open_smart_chat)Open Smart Chat

Smart Chat appears as a chat window in the Magnolia AdminCentral interface. You can toggle the window open and closed using the ![Chat icon icon](../_images/chat-icon.gif) Smart Chat icon in the toolbar.

Steps

1.  Click the Smart Chat icon in the AdminCentral toolbar.

2.  Type your request in the chat input.

3.  Press Enter or click **Send**.


| Task | Example prompt |
| --- | --- |
| List available apps | "What apps are available in Magnolia?" |
| Navigate to an app | "Take me to the Pages App" |
| Get information | "Show me the available content types" |
| Generate images | "Generate an image of a mountain landscape at sunset" |

## [](#_tool_results_in_the_chat)Tool results in the chat

When Smart Chat uses a tool, the results are displayed directly in the chat interface. Different tools render their results differently:

-   **Tables** - Structured data is displayed in sortable tables

-   **App lists** - Available apps are shown as clickable cards

-   **Images** - Generated images are displayed inline

-   **Navigation** - Confirmation messages when navigating to apps


## [](#_context_awareness)Context awareness

Smart Chat knows about your current context in Magnolia:

-   **Location** - Which app and subapp you’re currently in

-   **Selection** - Which content item (page, asset, etc.) you have selected


This allows Smart Chat to:

-   Provide context-relevant suggestions

-   Operate on selected content

-   Access tools that are only available in certain apps


For example, if you’re in the Pages app with a page selected, Smart Chat can access page-specific tools that aren’t available when you’re in the Assets App.

## [](#_approval_workflows)Approval workflows

Some actions require your explicit approval before Smart Chat executes them. When this happens, you see an approval request in the chat:

1.  Smart Chat explains what action it wants to perform.

2.  You can choose to **Approve** or **Reject** the action.

3.  Based on your choice, Smart Chat either proceeds or suggests alternatives.


This ensures you stay in control of important operations, especially for actions that change or remove content.

| Tip | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Be specific | Clear, specific prompts get better results than vague ones. |
| Provide context | If Smart Chat doesn’t know something, provide relevant context in your message. |
| Use follow-up questions | Build on previous responses rather than starting from scratch. |
| Review tool results | Always review the output from tools before proceeding with further actions. |
| Use natural language | Write as you would speak — Smart Chat understands conversational language. |
| Confirm edits | Double-check any generated or modified content before publishing. |
