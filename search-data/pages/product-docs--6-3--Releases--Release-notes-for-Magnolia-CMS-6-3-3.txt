## [](#_announcements)Announcements

-   [E-commerce](../../../../ecommerce/) `2.0.2` was released on December 13, 2024.


## [](#_improvements)Improvements

### [](#_system_performance)System performance

To improve the overall system performance, we’ve integrated optimizations to reduce the number of Jackrabbit observation subscribers, leading to a significant drop in memory allocations during authoring-related operations.

-   [MAGNOLIA-9533](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9533) Optimize `config` workspace observation setup

    This improvement is best considered in conjunction with the adoption of the newer cache flush and publishing policies brought to Magnolia 6.3.0 through [MAGNOLIA-9256](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9256), [MGNLADVCACHE-124](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLADVCACHE-124), [MGNLCACHE-360](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLCACHE-360), and [PUBLISHING-316](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PUBLISHING-316).

-   [MAGNOLIA-9524](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9524) Versioning performance improvements

-   [PUBLISHING-352](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PUBLISHING-352) The publication thread pool’s size should be configurable for performance

    You can now also configure the publication thread pool’s size. For more, see [Thread pool size](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Publishing-module/#_thread_pool_size).


### [](#_content_authoring)Content authoring

Several changes were made to enable the upcoming Page-editor Apps extension. Primarily, they remove the restriction that the Page Editor can only operate on content in the `website` workspace.

-   [MAGNOLIA-9526](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9526) Removing workspace check to ensure that templates can be retrieved from different workspaces

-   [MAGNOLIA-9300](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9300) Templating functions: generating localized links should support dynamic workspace

-   [MGNLSITE-226](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLSITE-226) Remove `website` workspace check to support Page-editor Apps


## [](#_bug_fixes)Bug fixes

-   [ADMINCTR-211](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/ADMINCTR-211) Unable to add password validation in user preferences

-   [MGNLCKE-32](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLCKE-32) CKEditor 5 not including plugins

    For more, see [Using a custom build](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/CKEditor5-customization/#_using_a_custom_build).

-   [MGNLDAM-1591](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-1591) Slow search results in Asset Chooser when S3 assets are connected

-   [MGNLUI-9092](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9092) **Show version** action doesn’t work in content apps

-   [SECURITY-40](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/SECURITY-40) Unable to add password validation


## [](#_miscellaneous)Miscellaneous

-   [MGNLTOMCAT-49](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLTOMCAT-49) Update `org.apache.tomcat:tomcat` dependency to `9.0.98`

-   [MGNLDAM-1533](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-1533) Remove action bar with preview from DAM asset chooser


## [](#_third_party_library_updates)Third-party library updates

This release comes with third-party library updates, see the [Magnolia Third-party library BOM 6.3.3](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/build/boms/-/blob/magnolia-bom-6.3.3/pom.xml?ref_type=tags).

### [](#_notable_updates)Notable updates

-   [BUILD-1307](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/BUILD-1307) Upgrade `jakarta.json` to `1.1.7-magnolia`

    With this update, we stop managing `javax.json:javax.json-api` in favor of `jakarta.json:jakarta.json-api`. We also introduce a new configuration property `org.eclipse.parsson.maxDepth` to limit the maximum level of nesting when parsing a JSON string. The default value is `1000`.

    You can set it as a system property by passing the following JVM argument:

    ```console
    -Dorg.eclipse.parsson.maxDepth=<value>
    ```
