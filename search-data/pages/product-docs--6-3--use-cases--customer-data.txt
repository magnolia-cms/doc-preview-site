## [](#_customer_data_modules)Customer data modules

Magnolia modules are shipped to you in different ways depending on your license:

-   **Community Edition (CE)**: Modules are included as part of the free and open-source version.

-   **DX Core**: Modules are included as part of the DX Core enterprise product. These modules are in addition to those in the Community Edition license where bundled.

-   **Special**: Some modules need their own special license as they are not included with CE or DX Core licenses. In some cases, an additional license is required.

    > **Tip:** For more details, see License.
