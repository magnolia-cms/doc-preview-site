# Support for DX Cloud Customers

**Latest Helm:** [1.17.2](https://gitlab.com/mironet/magnolia-helm/-/tags) **Archetype:** 1.10 **Cloud parent:** 6.3.14

Welcome to DX Cloud Support. We’re here to ensure your platform runs smoothly. Below, find key resources and guidance for getting help, reporting issues, and accessing best practices.

## [](#_magnolia_cloud_helpdesk)Magnolia Cloud Helpdesk

The Magnolia Cloud Helpdesk is your primary channel for reporting issues, tracking progress, and getting support.

### [](#_reporting_issues)Reporting issues

-   **Use a Personal Atlassian Account**: Log in to the [Magnolia Cloud Helpdesk portal](https://mgnl.io/cloud-helpdesk) with your individual Atlassian account to report issues or comment on tickets. This helps us identify and assist you efficiently.

-   **Emergency Access**: In urgent cases, if you do not already have a personal Atlassian account, create a limited Helpdesk-only account directly via the [Helpdesk portal](https://mgnl.io/cloud-helpdesk).

    > **Note:** For Magnolia partners, you should ensure that a unique email address is used for each subscription package you manage. This helps ensure easier ticket tracking and allows for a faster resolution for the emergency issue.


> **Warning:** When reporting a critical emergency issue outside of business hours, please also call the emergency phone number to notify us of the issue. The number is available in the Helpdesk portal.

### [](#_why_personal_accounts)Why personal accounts?

Using personal Atlassian accounts for issue reporting allows us to track your specific needs, streamline communication, and resolve issues faster. Shared accounts are reserved for notification purposes to maintain security and compliance.

### [](#_account_setup)Account Setup

    -   Personal name (no shared accounts, except for notifications)

    -   Company name

    -   Client name (if applicable)

    -   Individual email address (e.g., not [support@company.com](mailto:support@company.com))

    -   Phone number
