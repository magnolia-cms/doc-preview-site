# E-commerce Category Sync

[Commerce](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/commerce/) [Incubator](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/services/ecommerce-catalogsync) [ECOMCATSYN](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/ECOMCATSYN) [Magnolia 6.2](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:index.adoc) compatible

The **ecommerce-catalogsync** module brings everything you need to enhance e-commerce categories with data collected in Magnolia as well as to play them out in an optimized order. It is based on the [E-commerce module](../ecommerce/ecommerce-module/). For this purpose, the new [CategoryImportCommand](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/services/ecommerce-catalogsync/-/blob/main/src/main/java/info/magnolia/ecommerce/catalogsync/CategoryImportCommand.java) command is registered. To make use of this command, the [E-Commerce Categories](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/services/ecommerce-catalogsync/-/blob/main/src/main/resources/ecommerce-catalogsync-app/apps/ecommerce-catalogsync-app.yaml) app is registered, which can be extended as desired via decoration. For the Categories App, a special field is also provided with which the displayed order of the products of a category can be changed by using drag-and-drop.

> **Warning:** This module is at the INCUBATOR level.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

## [](#_usage)Usage

Once the E-Commerce Categories App module is installed and configured, a dedicated app becomes available in Magnolia AdminCentral. This app allows authors to synchronize categories between Magnolia and the connected external e-commerce provider.

The sync automatically retrieves the latest categories from Magnolia and updates your e-commerce provider accordingly. There is no need to select a page or vendor manually.

1.  In Magnolia, open the E-Commerce Categories App.

2.  In the action bar, click the Sync Categories action.
