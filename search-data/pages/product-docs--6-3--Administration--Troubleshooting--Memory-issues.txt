# Memory issues

## [](#_java_out_of_memory)Java out of memory

If the JVM does not have enough memory, `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` may appear in the startup log and Magnolia may fail to start.

```none
Exception in thread "Timer-1" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexingQueue.getFinishedDocuments
```

A solution is to increase Java heap size to allocate more memory to the JVM.

1.  Stop the server (`./magnolia_control.sh stop`).

2.  Open the `/apache-tomcat/bin/setenv.sh` file (`/apache-tomcat/bin/setenv.bat` on Windows) in a text editor.

3.  Edit the `Xmx` parameter to set a new maximum heap size.

    The default size for Magnolia is `2048M`. Try a higher number, for example, `4096M`.

4.  Save the file and start the server (`./magnolia_control.sh start && tail -f ../logs/catalina.out`).


## [](#_high_memory_usage_when_bootstrapping_content_on_first_startup)High memory usage when bootstrapping content on first startup

When importing content on first startup or installation, you may experience high memory usage or even an `OutOfMemoryError` (OOME) exception. The reason is that Jackrabbit keeps all changes in a transient space (and hence in memory) until the session is saved.

If the `Unable to complete bootstrapping: out of memory.` message is displayed, try to increase the maximum Java heap size with the `-Xmx` parameter in the server startup script.

> **Note:** You can also alleviate the issue by disabling the Jackrabbit search index for the import (commenting out the Magnolia index configuration in the workspace.xml configuration file(s)).
