# Magnolia 6.3.19 known issues

## [](#_circular_dependency_in_linktransformermanager)Circular dependency in LinkTransformerManager

In Magnolia 6.3.18 and 6.3.19, a circular dependency occurs when instantiating `info.magnolia.link.LinkTransformerManager`. This issue can cause the instance startup to fail or break custom code that calls `LinkTransformerManager` methods relying on JCR configuration.

The regression was caused by changes related to configurable trailing slashes for links ([MAGNOLIA-8378](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-8378)).

Symptoms include the following warning in the logs:

```text
WARN magnolia.jcr.node2bean.impl.Node2BeanProcessorImpl: Did not manage to create a bean for node [/server/rendering/linkManagement/transformers/completeURL], this part of configuration will be skipped
```

### [](#_workaround)Workaround

If your custom code calls `LinkTransformerManager` methods that read from the JCR configuration, update the code to use the direct getter methods ("non-JCR" methods) instead. The JCR-based methods may not accurately reflect the system’s state when `MultiSiteLinkTransformerManager` is active.

Replace calls to JCR-reading methods with their direct counterparts:

-   Instead of `getAbsoluteTransformer(boolean addContextPath)`, use `getAbsolute(boolean addContextPath)`.

-   Instead of `getCompleteURLTransformer()`, use `getCompleteUrl()`.


The issue is tracked in ticket [MAGNOLIA-9859](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9859).

We apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience while we resolve this issue.
