# Managing environments using the Magnolia cockpit

In this section and its subpages, you learn how to manage environments.

An environment consists of one or several *[spaces](../Cockpit/Magnolia-cockpit-concepts/#_space)*, which group together related functionality needed to build or deliver a site. The systems that a space actually contains and how they are connected is defined by the *[space’s setup](../Cockpit/Magnolia-cockpit-concepts/#_space_setup)*. A space is a container for one or more instances of Magnolia.

A cloud-based Magnolia package typically consists of three [environments](../Cockpit/Magnolia-cockpit-concepts/#_environment):

-   **Live**: Where the tested and approved version of the content product is delivered to customers.

-   **UAT** (User Acceptance Testing): Where the next version of the product is made available to editors and managers for testing and review.

-   **Integration**: Where developers try out ideas and test solutions before giving internal users access


## [](#_cloud_environments_vary)Cloud environments vary

Depending on your subscription package, the environments available to you may differ.

**For example:**

You may have only a single Live environment available, or only a UAT and a Live environment. In these cases, you can [deploy a development snapshot](../managing-updates-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/deploying-snapshot/) directly in the Live or in the UAT environment respectively.

Environments are managed in the **Manage environments** page.

To access this page, in the **Package overview** page, click **Manage environments**.
