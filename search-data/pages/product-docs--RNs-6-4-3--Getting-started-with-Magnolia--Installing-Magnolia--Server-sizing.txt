# Server sizing

Server sizing is a process that determines how many servers a client needs and how powerful they need to be. Every project needs different settings. The decision involves factors such as operating system, database, JVM and the number of page requests.

To provide you with a recommendation for server sizing, please fill the License Estimation Questionnaire. Your answers help us determine the number and type of servers needed.
