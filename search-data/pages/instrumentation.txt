# Instrumentation module

[Administration](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/administration/) [Tier 1](../incubator-modules/incubator-module-list/#_tier_1_modules) [Incubator](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/incubator/instrumentation) [INSTRUMENT](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/INSTRUMENT) [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

The **Magnolia Instrumentation** module provides "probes" for monitoring Magnolia internal metrics and activities over time. The probes are configurable within Magnolia and can be turned on and off. New probes can be added to Magnolia while it is running without restarting.

The probes provide their measurements to an external [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) server, a free and open source monitoring product, for storage. Prometheus stores the measurements in a time series database. The measurements stored in Prometheus can be accessed by other services to query and extract the measurements.

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an external server capable of analyzing and displaying time series from Prometheus and displaying the results in a graphs and dashboards. Grafana dashboards can contain bar graphs, line graphs, tables, dials, pie charts, text, histograms, heat maps and other visualizations of Prometheus time series data.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.services</groupId>
  <artifactId>instrumentation</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## [](#_monitoring_solutions)Monitoring solutions

We offer two monitoring solutions:

-   On premises monitoring

-   Cloud service monitoring


The on premises monitoring solution includes:

-   Instrumentation module (Magnolia provided, to be installed by the customer)

-   Standard configuration of instrumentation probes (Magnolia provided, to be installed by the customer)

-   Standard Grafana dashboards for instrumentation probes (Magnolia provided, to be installed by the customer)

-   Grafana server (customer provided)

-   Prometheus server (customer provided)


> **Note:** In the on premise solution, the Prometheus server collects the metrics measurements directly for the monitored Magnolia instance (a.k.a. "pull").

The cloud monitoring solution includes:

-   Instrumentation module (Magnolia provided)

-   Standard configuration of instrumentation probes (Magnolia provided)

-   Cloud instance with configured Prometheus, Grafana and data collection server (Magnolia provided)


> **Note:** In the cloud solution, the monitored Magnolia instance pushes metric measurements to the data collection server (a.k.a. "push").

### [](#_installing_monitoring)Installing Monitoring

Depending on the solution, on premise or cloud service, one or more of the following must be installed:

-   the Magnolia instrumentation module

-   configuration for instrumentation probes (may be bundled as a Magnolia module) Grafana server, plus configuration and dashboards (on premise solution only) Prometheus server plus configuration (on premise solution only)


> **Tip:** See Installing On Premises Monitoring for more on installing all of the above.

## [](#_instrumentation_probes)Instrumentation probes

The available instrumentation probes can be broken down into a number of groups:

### [](#_magnolia_configuration_probes)Magnolia configuration probes

**Magnolia configuration probes**: configured through the instrumentation module, these probes can collect:

-   whether the Magnolia instance is a public or author instance

-   the values of Magnolia properties

-   the values of repository properties

-   the values of Magnolia server configuration


> **Tip:** See Magnolia configuration probes for the available Magnolia configuration probes.

### [](#_jvm_probes)JVM probes

**JVM probes**: configured through the instrumentation module, these probes can measure:

-   class loading: total number of classes currently loaded, number of classes loaded, number of classes unloaded

-   garbage collection: number of garbage collections executed, running total of garbage collection time

-   memory pools: overall bytes used, committed, max available, bytes used in each memory pool

-   threads: current number of threads, peak number of threads used, total number of threads started

-   JVM: current JVM version and vendor

-   runtime metrics: number of processors, system load average, CPU time used by JVM


> **Tip:** See JVM probes for the available JVM probes.

### [](#_system_probes)System probes

**System probes**: configured through the instrumentation module, these probes can measure:

-   defined system properties: system properties in the JVM

-   defined environment properties: environment properties in the JVM


> **Tip:** See System probes for the available system probes.

### [](#_run_time_probes)Run time probes

**Run time probes**: configured through the instrumentation module, these probes can measure:

-   when the JVM started

-   how long the JVM has been running


> **Tip:** See Run time probes for the available run time probes.

### [](#_jmx_probes)JMX probes

**JMX probes**: configured through the instrumentation module, this probe can measure:

-   defined MxBean values inside and outside of Magnolia, e.g. Magnolia cache MxBeans, Tomcat MxBeans


> **Tip:** See JMX probes for more on the JMX probe.

### [](#_module_probes)Module probes

**Module probes**: configured through the instrumentation module, these probes can measure:

-   installed modules: each installed module and its current version as a separate measurement

-   installed modules: each installed module and its current version as metric labels


> **Tip:** See Module probes for more on the module probes.

### [](#_cache_probes)Cache probes

**Cache probes**: configured through the Magnolia cache module, these probes can measure:

-   cache actions: counts of gets, puts, removes and clears


> **Tip:** See Cache probes for more.

### [](#_rendering_probes)Rendering probes

**Rendering probes**: configured through the Magnolia rendering engine, these probes can measure:

-   rendering times: collects times for rendering of individual pages, areas and components

-   rendering times: collects times for rendering of individual pages, areas and components for histograms


> **Tip:** See Rendering probes for more on configuring and using rendering probes.

### [](#_filter_probes)Filter probes

**Filter probes**: configured in the Magnolia filter chain, these probes can measure:

-   processing time: from probe filter

-   processing time: between starting filter and ending filter

-   processing time: collects processing time from probe filter for histograms

-   number of executions: of probe filter

-   Servlet context information


> **Note:** All filter probes can be configured with Magnolia voters to measure or ignore filter chain requests by URL.

> **Tip:** See Filter probes for more on measuring request processing by the Magnolia filter chain.

### [](#_machine_probes)Machine probes

**Machine probes**: configured through Magnolia, the machine probes can measure:

-   number of available processors

### [](#_logging_probes)Logging probes

**Logging probes**: configured through the logging configuration (log4j.xml) for Magnolia, this probe can measure:

-   counts of logging messages: by log level and source

-   counts of logging messages: by log level and source, filtered by message


> **Tip:** See Logging probes for more on logging probes.

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `job` | The Prometheus job name that collected the measurement, the label value corresponds to a job defined in the Prometheus configuration. |
| `instance` | Identifies the host instance defined in the Prometheus job that collected the measurement |

| Property | Default | Description |
