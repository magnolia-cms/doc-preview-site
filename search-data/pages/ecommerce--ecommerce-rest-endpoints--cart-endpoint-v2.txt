# Cart endpoint v2

This page describes the v2 `cart` endpoint, which can be used to interact with your external e-commerce solution’s REST shopping cart service.

In v2, `cartId` is a path parameter instead of form parameter in the REST calls. For example the v1 `/carts/items` becomes in v2 `/carts/{cartId}/items`. The other parts of the call are unchanged. Also, the "get cart by user" path changed from v1 `/carts/user` to v2 `/carts/users/{userId}`.

With this endpoint, you can:

-   Create a cart anonymously or as an authenticated user.

-   Add an item to a cart.

-   Change the quantity of items in a cart.

-   Remove an item from a cart.
