# Publishing performance

On this page, you’ll find an outline of some possibilities to increase publishing performance. Specifically, you’ll read about options to improve the handling of publishing many nodes simultaneously, reduce the number of requests sent to the server, and optimize certain database parameters.

Publishing too many nodes at the same time can cause massive numbers of publication requests. This is illustrated in the example in the next section.

## [](#_publication_requests)Publication requests

Consider the tour categories depicted below in the **Tour Categories** app.

![Tour Categories app](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2_tour-categories.png)

If you publish the root node, it’ll generate `15` requests as it is with the out-of-the-box configuration.

Log entries when publishing all 15 nodes separately

```

In this example, 15 requests is not a massive amount of requests, but if you had many more nodes, you can see how quickly the total amount of requests could accumulate when publishing an entire folder.

## [](#_fewer_publication_requests_by_publishing_pages_separately)Fewer publication requests by publishing pages separately

If you publish a node in your browser app, you can also publish all subnodes and subpages. This publish-by-folder approach might be convenient if you publish several unpublished pages in the same folder. However, a folder containing many published pages would create unnecessary publishing requests. In this case, you should publish the folder using the `itemsPerRequest` option described below.

## [](#_fewer_publication_requests_using_itemsperrequest)Fewer publication requests using itemsPerRequest

You can reduce the number of publishing requests created by configuring the `itemsPerRequest` property for the browser view in the `tourCategories.yaml` file. For example, let’s look at what happens when we allow up to `10` items per request.

tourCategories.yaml

```yaml
subApps:
  browser:
    workbench:
      contentViews:
        - name: tree
          columns:
            jcrName:
              editable: false
    actions:
      editCategory:
        appName: tourCategories
      addCategory:
        appName: tourCategories
      publish:
        params:
          itemsPerRequest: 10 (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | `itemsPerRequest` is set to `10` |

After clicking the **Publish** action, you’d see that there are now only `3` publishing requests in the log. This is because the folders under `root` each contain less than `10` items, so the items within each folder can be published together rather than in separate requests.

Log entries when publishing with itemsPerRequest equal to 10

```bash
2023-08-08 09:57:37,366 INFO  ing.receiver.operation.jcr.JcrPublicationOperation: About to update content under path [/root].
2023-08-08 09:57:37,398 INFO  ing.receiver.operation.jcr.JcrPublicationOperation: About to update content under path [/root/tour-types].
2023-08-08 09:57:37,455 INFO  ing.receiver.operation.jcr.JcrPublicationOperation: About to update content under path [/root/destinations].
```

Please go to the [Configuring itemsPerRequest](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Publishing-module/#_configuring_itemsperrequest) section for more information on the configuration details for `itemsPerRequest`.
