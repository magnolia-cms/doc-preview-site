# Cookies app

Use the Cookies app to manage cookies that require consent from your website visitors.

The cookies you use on your website have different origins: some come from third-party services such as Google Analytics, others from Magnolia features. One example of a Magnolia cookie is the VISITOR cookie used by the visitor trait to serve [personalized](../../../use-cases/Personalization/) content.

## [](#_app_definition)App definition

The Cookies app is defined in a YAML file. This YAML file resides in the Magnolia Maven module called `magnolia-privacy-ui`, which is part of the [Privacy module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Privacy-module/).

If you want to change the app definition, you can [decorate](../../../Developing/Definition-decoration/) it, create a copy in the `resources` workspace with the [Resource Files app](../../../Developing/Resources/#_resource_files_app) or create a copy in a file-based light module using the Magnolia [resources origins loading order](../../../Developing/Resources/#_origins_and_loading_order).

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | **required** Cookie’s unique ID. The node name is used as the `id` . The identifier is required to get info.magnolia.consent.cookie.definition.CookieDefinition from info.magnolia.consent.cookie.CookieManager (see [Data privacy API: Managing cookies](../../../Developing/API/Java-Server-APIs/Data-privacy-API/#_managing_cookies) ). |
| `cookieName` | **required** The name of the cookie as seen in the browser. |
| `value` | **optional** The value of the cookie. |
| `domain` | **optional** The domain within which this cookie should be presented. |
| `path` | **optional** The path for the cookie to which the client should return the cookie. Leave empty if the cookie should be valid just for the subtree of the active page. Use `/` if the cookie should be valid for whole domain. |
| `maxAge` | **optional** , default is `-1` The maximum age of this cookie (in seconds). The default value -1 creates a cookie that expires when you shut down the browser. |
| `requiredConsentRegexp` | **optional** , default is `.+` A regular expression used to determine whether a cookie will be set or not. |
| `secure` | **optional** , default is `false` Indicates to the browser whether the cookie should only be sent using a secure protocol, such as HTTPS or SSL. |
| `isHttpOnly` | **optional** , default is `true` HttpOnly cookies are not supposed to be exposed to client-side scripting code, and may therefore help mitigate certain kinds of cross-site scripting attacks. |
| `enabled` | **optional** , default is `true` Set to `false` to disable the cookie definition. |
| `comment` | **optional** This property cannot be edited using the Cookies app. Instead you must create localized [i18n message keys](../../../Administration/Language/Internationalization/#_i18n_message_keys) for this property. The format of the i18n key is `cookies.$cookiesId.comment` . |
