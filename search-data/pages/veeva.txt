# Veeva DAM Connector module

[Digital asset management (DAM)](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) [Incubator](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/incubator/veeva-parent) Version [2.0.0](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/VEEVA) [Magnolia 6.3+](../product-docs/6.3/) compatible\[[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")\]

The **Veeva DAM Connector module** serves as a Digital Asset Management (DAM) connector for Magnolia, enabling seamless integration with [Veeva](https://www.veeva.com/). The connector facilitates browsing images and provides a dialog for incorporating these images and videos directly into your website.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.external.dam</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-external-dam-veeva</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

Add the following configuration to the `config.yaml`, JCR, or alternatively, decorate it from another module. The following values are found in your Veeva account.

-   `dns`: Veeva DNS

-   `apiUsername`: Veeva Username

-   `apiPassword`: Veeva Password

-   `clientId`: Veeva Client ID


Alternatively, username and password can be stored in Magnolia’s Password Manager app. Create entries for these first and then modify `config.yaml` to reference these entries via absolute paths. eg.

```yaml
apiUsername: "/veevaVault/apiUsername"
apiPassword: "/veevaVault/apiPassword"
```

## [](#_per_user_authentication)Per-user authentication

In a large organisation, it may not be ideal for every user to access the Veeva API via the same account. A user can access the API with their own credentials by opening the user preferences dialog and, under the 'Veeva access' tab, entering their Veeva username and password. If they check the box marked 'Use own Veeva credentials?' the will only see Veeva content in the Magnolia UI that their account is allowed access to.

Notes:

-   A central account is still needed for rendering content for anonymous website viewers.

-   Clients are cached for users. A user changing their credentials or opting to use their own credentials for the first time should log out for at least five minutes.


## [](#_usage)Usage

Once the module has been installed, you can add assets to the website and/or apps by using the default link field. There are three types of objects that you can use from Veeva:

-   asset

-   text

-   module


Asset example

![veeva chooser](_images/veeva-chooser.png)

-   Asset

-   Text

-   Module


```yaml
  veevaImage:
    $type: linkField
    label: Choose Veeva Asset Element
    chooserId: dam-veeva:chooser-asset
    datasource:
      $type: veeva-asset
      preview:
        variationName: preview
```

```yaml
  veevaText:
    $type: linkField
    label: Choose Veeva Text Element
    chooserId: dam-veeva:chooser-text
    datasource:
      $type: veeva-text
```

```yaml
  veevaModule:
    label: Choose Veeva Module Element
    $type: linkField
    chooserId: dam-veeva:chooser-module
    datasource:
        $type: veeva-module
```

### [](#_call_veeva_objects)Call Veeva objects

In the templates, access the Veeva objects by calling Veeva templating functions:

```java
veevafn.getVeevaText(veevaTextId!)! (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Where `veevafn` is the function, `getVeevaText` is the method. See `info.magnolia.external.dam.veeva.templating.VeevaTemplatingFunctions` for more details. |

### [](#_link_to_veeva_asset)Link to Veeva asset

Link to a Veeva asset using Magnolia’s DAM servlet:

```none
link = ctx.contextPath + "/dam/" + node.veevaImage!
```

### [](#_veeva_endpoints)Veeva endpoints

You can also use the following endpoints to retrieve data from Veeva:

-   Asset: Retrieve asset by id, GET "/veeva/asset/{id}"

-   Text: Retrieve text by id, GET "/veeva/text/{id}"

-   Module: Retrieve module by id, GET "/veeva/module/{id}"
