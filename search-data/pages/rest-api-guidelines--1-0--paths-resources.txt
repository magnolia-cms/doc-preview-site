# REST Design – Paths and Resources

Defines rules for structuring API paths and resources, including trailing slash handling, path segment conventions, and limits on resource hierarchy depth.

## [](#136)**MUST** avoid trailing slashes \[136\]

Adopted

URLs must not end with a trailing slash.

A trailing slash does not add any value and may cause confusion or inconsistent behavior with caching and routing. Tools and frameworks should normalize URLs to consistently omit trailing slashes.

Example: \* Correct: `/orders/123` \* Incorrect: `/orders/123/`

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #136](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#136)

## [](#143)**MUST** resources must be identified via path segments \[143\]

Adopted

Resources must be identified via path segments, not via query parameters.

Example: \* Correct: `/orders/123` \* Incorrect: `/orders?id=123`

Path segments make the resource hierarchy clear and enable proper HTTP caching.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #143](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#143)

## [](#145)**MAY** consider using (non-)nested URLs \[145\]

Adopted

APIs may use either nested or flat URL structures depending on the use case.

Nested URLs (e.g., `/customers/123/orders`) clearly express parent-child relationships but can become unwieldy for deeply nested resources.

Flat URLs (e.g., `/orders?customerId=123`) are simpler and work well when resources can exist independently or have multiple relationships.

Choose the approach that best fits the domain model and access patterns.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #145](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#145)

## [](#146)**SHOULD** limit number of resource types \[146\]

Adopted

APIs should limit the number of resource types to keep the API manageable and understandable.

A large number of resource types may indicate that the API is trying to do too much and should be split into smaller, more focused APIs.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #146](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#146)

## [](#147)**SHOULD** limit number of sub-resource levels \[147\]

Adopted

APIs should limit the depth of nested sub-resources to a maximum of 3 levels.

Deeply nested URLs become difficult to read, understand, and maintain. If deeper nesting is required, consider using flat URLs with query parameters or redesigning the resource model.

Example: \* Acceptable: `/customers/123/orders/456/items` \* Too deep: `/customers/123/orders/456/items/789/details/attributes`
