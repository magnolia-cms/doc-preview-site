## [](#_connection_configuration)Connection configuration

See the following pages for detailed information about connecting to and configuring your external DAM solution:

-   [AWS S3 extension configuration](../external-dam-s3-config/)

-   [Bynder extension configuration](../external-dam-bynder-config/)


Essentially, you:

-   Provide connection credentials for your external solution.

-   Enable the subapp to display in the Magnolia [Assets app](../../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Assets-app/).

-   Configure the cache if necessary.


You can create or edit the configuration in the JCR or the File System (YAML) under `<module-name>/external-dams/<definition-name>`.

Before you configure the connection, make sure you know:

-   Which solution you want to connect to. Default implementations are provided for:

    -   AWS S3

    -   Bynder


-   Connection credentials for your solution.


> **Note:** If you want to connect to another third-party tool, extend the Magnolia DAM API and create your own asset provider

> **Tip:** There are several additional DAM connector modules. For more details, see Digital asset management modules.
