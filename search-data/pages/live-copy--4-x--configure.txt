# Configuring Live Copy

## [](#_assign_live_copy_admins)Assign live copy admins

Live Copies enable editors to create copies of content anywhere, on other sites. While this is very powerful, it doesn’t copy content permissions (or restrictions) as configured by [roles and access control lists](../../../product-docs/6.3/Administration/IAM/Roles-and-access-control-lists/) (ACLs). Since Live Copy `4.0.2`, only users with the [livecopy-admin](../../../product-docs/6.3/Administration/IAM/Roles-groups-and-users/#_default_roles_groups_and_users_in_dx_core_webapp) role may create and update live copies (i.e., propagate master changes). Users with this role are responsible for maintaining consistency of access control, in combination with live copies, and should have visibility over the entire workspace.

To assign this role to a user:

1.  Open the Security app.

2.  Edit an existing user or add a new one.

3.  Go to the **Roles** tab.

4.  Select the `livecopy-admin` role on the left side of the table.

5.  Click **\>** to grant it to the user.

6.  **Save changes**.


## [](#_create_live_copy_site_definition)Create live copy site definition

Coordinate with your authors to create a matching site definition for any live copy sites they create.

Go to [Configuring a site definition](../../../product-docs/6.3/Developing/Templating/Site-definition/#_configuring_a_site_definition) to create a new one for your live copy. Duplicate the master site by making a copy in the Configuration app or a light module folder.

| Master | Live copy |
| --- | --- |
| title = Hello world | title = Hello world |
| title_de = Hallo Welt | title_de = Hallo Welt |

| ⸬ pushContentChangesAndPublish |  |
| --- | --- |
| ⸬ publishPropagatedContent |  |
| ⬩ class | info.magnolia.livecopy.command.SynchronizeLiveCopyTreeCommand |

## [](#_create_live_copy_action)Create live copy action

You can configure the following for the **Create live copy** action:

-   Parallel or sequential creation

    Allow users to create multiple live copies in parallel, or block the action (and the push changes actions) to prevent new creations once a creation operation has started. By default, live copy creation is set to run sequentially for performance reasons.

-   Child node copying

    Allow users to create live copies of child nodes even when the parent node is already being copied. By default, users can’t create live copies of child nodes if the parent node is being copied.


/<your-module>/decorations/pages-app/apps/pages-app.subApps.browser.actions.createLiveCopy.availability.rules.yaml

```yaml
IsLiveCopyRunningRule:
  class: info.magnolia.livecopy.app.availability.IsLiveCopyRunningRuleDefinition
  parallel: false (1)
  recursive: true (2)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The `parallel` property from info.magnolia.livecopy.app.availability.IsLiveCopyRunningRuleDefinition, set to `false` by default.<br><br>Once a create live copy action starts, you can’t perform any additional creation or push changes operations until it is complete. Set to `true` to allow multiple live copy creation actions to run in parallel. Note that this may affect performance if many copies are created simultaneously. |
| **2** | The `recursive` property from info.magnolia.livecopy.app.availability.IsLiveCopyRunningRuleDefinition, set to `true` by default.<br><br>When the create live copy action is triggered for a parent node, both the node *and its children* are locked, making the action unavailable until the parent node live copy creation completes. Set to `false` to allow live copies of child nodes to be created while the operation is still running for the parent node. |

## [](#_disable_concurrent_push_operations)Disable concurrent push operations

Live Copy 4.1.0 introduces an [action availability rule](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/App-configuration/Action-definition/#_action_availability) that prevents users from starting another push operation (**Push master changes** or **Push master changes incl. subnodes**) while one is already in progress on the same path.

By default, the rule is not enabled.

To enable it, add the `enabledOperationConcurrencyLimiter` property to the Live Copy module configuration and set it to `true`:

/<your-module>/decorations/livecopy/config.yaml

```yaml
enabledOperationConcurrencyLimiter: true
```

The info.magnolia.livecopy.app.availability.IsPushMasterChangeRunningRuleDefinition rule is already defined by default in the Pages app configuration:

/pages-app/apps/pages-app.subApps.browser.actions.yaml

```yaml
isPushMasterChangeRunningRule:
  $type: isPushMasterChangeRunningRule
```

Once enabled, this rule disables the **Push master changes** and **Push master changes incl. subnodes** actions if one is already running on the same path.

## [](#_enable_content_deletion_without_protecting_pages_from_master_updates)Enable content deletion without protecting pages from master updates

Suppose your authors want to delete content, such as a specific component, from a live copy page but they don’t want to [protect the whole page from master changes](../usage/manage-live-copy/#_protect_content_from_master_content_changes). In this case, what happens is the deleted content is added again when they push the master page.

To work around the content being added to the page again, you can add a no rendering option to the respective master component using an `if` condition in its FTL file (example shown below).

```html
[#if "${content.headline}" != "hide"]
<div class="card">
    <h1>${content.headline}</h1>
    [#assign myAsset = damfn.getAsset("jcr","/an-asset.jpg")!]
    [#if myAsset??]
        <img src="${myAsset.getLink()}" width="300px"/>
    [/#if]
    <p class="artwork_title">${content.text}</p>
    [#assign myAssetLink = damfn.getAssetLink("jcr:20f53452-7e37-4e1b-b10d-c085a703809d")!]
    <p class="webapp_link">${myAssetLink}</p>
    <p class="webapp_link">${content.pageLink}</p>
</div>
[/#if]
```
