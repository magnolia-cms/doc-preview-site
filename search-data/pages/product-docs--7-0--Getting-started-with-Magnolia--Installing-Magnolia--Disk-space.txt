# Disk space

The amount disk space required for a Magnolia instance depends on what data you store and how many versions of content you keep. Today, marketing oriented websites use a lot of images and video. It is not uncommon for such a website to have 5-10 GB of Web content.

> **Note:** We recommend you allocate at least 50GB of disk space for an author instance and 25GB for a public instance.

| Item | `GB` |
| --- | --- |
| **Total website content**<br><br>Including assets such as images and videos. | 5   |
| **Magnolia and Tomcat systems** | 0.5 |
| **Cached content**<br><br>Assuming cache is 70% full. | 3.5 |
| **Site is served in two languages**<br><br>The other language is also cached. | 3.5 |
| **Content indexed for search**<br><br>A compressed index is `20%` of the original data size. | 1   |
| **Logs**<br><br>Access, audit, and errors. | 5   |
| **Temporary storage**<br><br>For streaming large files. | 5   |
| **Total for a public instance** | 23.5 |
| **Versioning on author instance**<br><br>Assuming 30% of content is versioned `20` times. | 30  |
| **Total for an author instance** | 53.5 |

Adjust the numbers to your needs

-   Is your site smaller?

-   Is your database on the same machine as the application server? You can also persist data to a remote database.

-   Have you switched off versioning?


There are many options for reducing the space required. However, assume that you need up to `50GB` of space out of the box at a minimum.
