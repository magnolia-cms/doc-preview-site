# Configure AI-powered text fields

**Available from version `1.0.5`**

You can generate text in a `textField` based on a self-defined translatable prompt which you can enrich with variable content from the dialog properties. Generate text automatically in a text field based on a developer-defined prompt, which can include dynamic variables from the dialog’s properties. AI-powered text fields are designed to create tailored content (e.g., descriptions) with minimal user input, streamlining content creation.

Recap

-   **Use case**: Ideal for generating structured, context-specific text, like product descriptions or metadata, based on predefined rules.

-   **Example**: A field generating a 100-word description using variables from other form fields (e.g., tags).


| Callout | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | `prompt` | **required** The `prompt` field defines the instruction given to the AI to generate the text value. It can be either fixed in the field definition or defined by the `i18n` property key. Variable substitutions are available. In addition to self-definable variables via the property `properties` , the `${lang}` variable is also available. This variable inserts the language currently being edited at the position used. |
| **2** | `words` | **optional** , *default is `50`* Defines the maximum words returned. |
| **3** | `rows` | **optional** , *default is `2`* Defines the initial height of the textarea. |
| **4** | `properties` | **optional** Defines properties for variable substitution in the prompt. The key is used as name for the variable. The value defines the name of the field from the form definition e.g. of the dialog. |
