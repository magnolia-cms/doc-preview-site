# Site-aware exception handling

This guide explains how to configure site-aware exception handling to deliver customized, user-friendly error pages for each site.

Magnolia CMS supports multiple sites, each mapped to distinct URLs, domains, or hosts. By default, errors like HTTP 404 (Resource Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error) display the web container’s technical error page, which is not user-friendly.
