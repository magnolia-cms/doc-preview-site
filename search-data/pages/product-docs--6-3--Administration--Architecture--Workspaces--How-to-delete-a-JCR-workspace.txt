# How to delete a JCR workspace

This page explains how to delete a JCR workspace on a Magnolia system.

## [](#_jcr_api_and_jackrabbit)JCR API and Jackrabbit

You *cannot* delete a JCR workspace programmatically with Magnolia. You must delete it manually.

[Apache Jackrabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/), which is the JCR implementation used by Magnolia, doesn’t implement the `#deleteWorkpace` method defined in the JCR 2.0 API (see [javax.jcr.Workspace](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/spec/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-2.0/javax/jcr/Workspace.html)).

`org.apache.jackrabbit.core.WorkspaceImpl#delete`

```java
public void deleteWorkspace(String name) throws AccessDeniedException, UnsupportedRepositoryOperationException, RepositoryException {
  this.context.getRepository().getWorkspaceInfo(name);
  this.context.getAccessManager().checkRepositoryPermission(32768);
  throw new UnsupportedRepositoryOperationException("not yet implemented");
}
```

| `magnolia.repositories.home` | `/var/lib/author/tomcat/webapps/author/repositories` |

| Workspace name | `dms` |
| Folder to delete | `/var/lib/author/tomcat/webapps/author/repositories/magnolia/workspaces/dms` |

## [](#_multiple_instances_and_clustering)Multiple instances and clustering

Depending on how your Magnolia [instances](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Instances/) are set up and if you use [clustering](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Instances/Clustering/), you must delete a workspace in one or several locations.

> **Note:** Make sure you delete the workspace on both the author instance and on all public instances.
