# FAQ

## [](#_why_doesnt_package_manager_reopen_my_previously_open_package_when_i_switch_between_apps)Why doesn’t Package Manager reopen my previously open package when I switch between apps?

The Package Manager app is a bit different from other apps in Magnolia. It uses Magnolia’s [new design system](https://ds.magnolia-cloud.com) and frontend technology, and is displayed in an iframe within the classic Magnolia interface. Because of this, Package Manager doesn’t preserve the last working state across app switches. If you leave a package editor view in Package Manager, for example, to open the Pages app, and then reopen Package Manager, it returns to the browser view. Consider opening other apps in a new tab/window to keep your editing context.

## [](#_should_i_install_packages_directly_on_public_instances)Should I install packages directly on public instances?

While it is technically possible to use Package Manager to install packages directly on public instances, it’s not recommended. Installing content on a public instance can create content differences between your author and public instances. A safer approach is to install your package on the author instance and then publish the freshly installed content to public instances.

If you need to install content on a public instance, consider the following:

-   Any content installed on a public instance is publicly available immediately.

-   If you do need to install your package on public instances, it’s good practice to install the same package on your author instance as well.


## [](#_should_i_mix_import_mechanisms)Should I mix import mechanisms?

If you intermix Magnolia’s Export/Import with Package Manager on the same paths, you can run into node collisions due to differing UUIDs between the target and the package.

Example scenario:

1.  Export `/travel` from the source using Magnolia’s Export action (not Package Manager).

2.  Import that file into the target under root, which creates `/travel` on the target (using Magnolia’s Import action).

3.  Build a package for `/travel` on the source (using Package Manager).

4.  Install the package on the target (using Package Manager).


Result: The installation may fail with a node collision error because the target already contains nodes at the same paths with UUIDs that differ from those in the package.

How to avoid or fix:

-   Use a single import strategy for a given path. Prefer building and installing with Package Manager end-to-end.

-   If the target already contains content created via Export/Import:

-   Install the package with `Replace` to remove the existing subtree before importing, or

-   Delete the existing subtree on the target and then install, or

-   Re-create the target content by installing the package first, rather than importing it manually.
