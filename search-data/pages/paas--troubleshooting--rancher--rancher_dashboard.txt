# Rancher UI Dashboard

The Rancher UI Dashboard, also known as the *Rancher Cluster Explorer*, simplifies the access, interaction, and management of multiple Kubernetes Clusters. Although the UI is quite intuitive, [Rancher 2.6](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/) introduced a few changes in the UI that you should be aware of.

> **Tip:** For a full walkthrough of the Rancher dashboard, check out Rancher’s UI Walkthrough Guide.

If you have missed any component such as a `workload`, `secret`, `ingress`, or something else, you need to ensure that you have the correct namespace selected, as those items won’t be displayed otherwise:
