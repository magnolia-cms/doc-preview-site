# REST Design – Documentation

Defines the foundational rules for API documentation, emphasizing the use of OpenAPI as the single source of truth. It clarifies which Zalando documentation rules are adopted and which are intentionally skipped based on Magnolia’s scope and tooling.

## [](#101)**MUST** provide API specification using OpenAPI \[101\]

Adopted

All APIs must be described using an OpenAPI specification. The OpenAPI description serves as the single source of truth for the API and must be kept up to date.

The OpenAPI specification must be complete enough to allow client developers to understand and use the API without further explanation.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #101](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#101)

## [](#215)**MUST** provide API identifier \[215\]

Skipped

Rationale: The API title and version provided as part of the API meta information already uniquely describe the API in our context. Introducing an additional API identifier would be redundant and provide no additional value.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #215](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#215)

## [](#218)**MUST** contain API meta information \[218\]

Skipped

Rationale: Magnolia uses its own metadata format for API documentation. The Zalando-specific metadata fields (x-api-id, x-audience) are not applicable in our context.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #218](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#218)

## [](#219)**MUST** provide API audience \[219\]

Skipped

Rationale: The API audience classification (component-internal, business-unit-internal, company-internal, external-partner, external-public) is a Zalando-specific taxonomy that is not applicable to Magnolia APIs.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #219](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#219)

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `draft` | API is under development and not ready for consumption |
| `experimental` | API is available for testing but may change without notice |
| `stable` | API is production-ready with backward-compatibility guarantees |
| `deprecated` | API is scheduled for removal; consumers should migrate |
