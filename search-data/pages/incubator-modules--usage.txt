# Installation

## [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

-   In-depth Magnolia knowledge and project experience are required.

-   Running Magnolia instance is necessary.

-   Expertise in Java and/or Magnolia Light Development, as well as relevant technology stack.

-   Access to the project repository is essential.


> **Important:** Configuration is typically performed independently (both the environment and code levels), with no direct assistance from Magnolia Services. For urgent support, additional help can be obtained through a separately purchased on-demand service package.

## [](#_dependencies)Dependencies

-   Valid and correct Magnolia DX Core license is required.

-   Some Incubator modules may depend on paid connectors.

-   Some Incubator modules may depend on other Magnolia modules.


## [](#_credentials)Credentials

-   Access to the official Magnolia Nexus repository.

-   Any required free or licensed credentials for third-party applications.


> **Important:** You are responsible for obtaining, managing, and securing any required free or licensed credentials for third-party applications.

## [](#_customization)Customization

Incubator extension modules can be downloaded directly from the official Magnolia Nexus repository. Once downloaded, you also gain access to the module’s repository, allowing you to extend the module.

Extensions can be created either by building a new module that depends on the base module or by forking the repository. You are also welcome to contribute to the Incubator module by submitting pull requests to Magnolia’s repository.

> **Important:** Maintenance of any extended functionality is outside Magnolia’s scope, and we cannot guarantee that submitted pull requests will be merged.
