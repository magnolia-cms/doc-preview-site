# Security and authentication

![useCase security](../../_images/features/useCase-security.jpg)

Magnolia offers security and authentication tools, encompassing a default security app module, Single Sign-On (SSO) module, and extendable connectors for comprehensive protection. The default security app module ensures a solid foundation for user access control, allowing administrators to define permissions and roles.

Our SSO module enhances user convenience and security by enabling seamless authentication across multiple applications. Magnolia’s extendable connectors further bolster security measures, providing flexibility for integration with various authentication systems. This multifaceted approach ensures that organizations can implement stringent security protocols, safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining a secure digital environment within the Magnolia CMS platform.
