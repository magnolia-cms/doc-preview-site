# Recognizing images

The image recognition and tagging action is executed during the startup of the author instance and every time you upload a new image asset.

You can also trigger the action manually in the Assets app by selecting one or more assets and clicking the **Run recognition** action.

Images that have already been tagged are marked as such using a JCR property called `lastTaggingAttemptDate`. Executing the manual **Run recognition** action forces a new tag to be set even if the image was previously tagged.

> **Note:** The image recognition feature is available only on author instances.

## [](#_removing_tags)Removing tags

Once an image has been tagged, you can remove some or all of the tags by selecting the asset and clicking the **Modify tags** action in the Assets app.

In the dialog box that opens, you can remove individual tags or click **Remove all tags**.
