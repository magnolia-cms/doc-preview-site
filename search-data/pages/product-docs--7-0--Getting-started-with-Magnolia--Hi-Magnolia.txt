| • Find the `light-modules` folder inside the Magnolia installation directory. For example purposes, let’s say you named the installation folder `magnolia` . The CLI v5 `npx @magnolia/cli jumpstart` command created the `light-modules` for you when installing Magnolia. ** Your Magnolia installation continually monitors the `light-modules` folder, and any folders or files created there are added to the definitions available in Magnolia. | ** | Your Magnolia installation continually monitors the `light-modules` folder, and any folders or files created there are added to the definitions available in Magnolia. | The default root folder structure after installation with [Magnolia CLI v5](../../../../magnolia-cli/getting-started/jumpstarting/) is below. 📁 magnolia 📁 apache-tomcat 📁 light-modules 📁 node_modules | 📁 magnolia | 📁 apache-tomcat | 📁 light-modules | 📁 node_modules |

| • Creating the `hi-magnolia` module folder, a template folder and adding template files. • 📁📁 In `light-modules` , create the `hi-magnolia` subfolder and then the `templates` folder inside it. • 📁 In `templates` , create another subfolder called `pages` . • 📄📄 Add both page template files ⤓⤓ [magnolia123.yaml](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_attachments/hi-magnolia/templates/pages/magnolia123.yaml) and [magnolia123.ftl](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_attachments/hi-magnolia/templates/pages/magnolia123.ftl) . ** *Page templates* (files with the `.yaml` extension) contain details about areas on a page and how pages are turned into HTML. *Template scripts* (ones with the `.ftl` extension) turn those templates into final HTML page files. | ** | *Page templates* (files with the `.yaml` extension) contain details about areas on a page and how pages are turned into HTML. *Template scripts* (ones with the `.ftl` extension) turn those templates into final HTML page files. | 📁 light-modules 📁 hi-magnolia 📁 templates 📁 pages magnolia123.yaml magnolia123.ftl | 📁 light-modules | 📁 hi-magnolia | 📁 templates | 📁 pages | magnolia123.yaml | magnolia123.ftl |

| • Creating the component template folder and files. • 📁 Create the `components` subfolder inside the `templates` folder. • 📄📄 Add the `paragraph` component files ⤓⤓ [paragraph.yaml](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_attachments/hi-magnolia/templates/components/paragraph.yaml) and [paragraph.ftl](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_attachments/hi-magnolia/templates/components/paragraph.ftl) inside it. • 📄📄 Add the `title` component files ⤓⤓ [title.yaml](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_attachments/hi-magnolia/templates/components/title.yaml) and [title.ftl](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_attachments/hi-magnolia/templates/components/title.ftl) inside it as well. ** *Component templates* refer to single components on a page such as text, images, and links, much in the same way page templates refer to areas as a whole. | ** | *Component templates* refer to single components on a page such as text, images, and links, much in the same way page templates refer to areas as a whole. | 📁 hi-magnolia 📁 templates 📁 components paragraph.yaml paragraph.ftl title.yaml title.ftl | 📁 hi-magnolia | 📁 templates | 📁 components | paragraph.yaml | paragraph.ftl | title.yaml | title.ftl |

| • Creating the dialog folders and files. • 📁 Create the `dialogs` subfolder inside the `hi-magnolia` folder. • 📁📁 Under that, create two subfolders, `components` and `pages` . • 📄📄 Copy the component dialog files ⤓⤓ [paragraph.yaml](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_attachments/hi-magnolia/dialogs/components/paragraph.yaml) and [title.yaml](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_attachments/hi-magnolia/dialogs/components/paragraph.yaml) into the `components` folder, as depicted on the right. • 📄 Copy the page dialog file ⤓ [magnolia123.yaml](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_attachments/hi-magnolia/dialogs/pages/magnolia123.yaml) into the `pages` folder, as depicted on the right. ** *Dialogs* are how authors enter content into Magnolia. Dialog definitions specify editable fields where editors can add or update the content itself. In addition, they may define operations that authors can do on the content, for example, commit or cancel. | ** | *Dialogs* are how authors enter content into Magnolia.
