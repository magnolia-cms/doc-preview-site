### [](#_lazy_component_loading_not_working_with_angular_v17_ssg)Lazy component loading not working with Angular v17+ SSG

The prerendering (SSG) using the [application builder](https://v17.angular.io/guide/esbuild) (introduced in Angular v17) breaks the component lazy-loading feature of the Magnolia front-end library.

**Workaround**

Use the legacy `@angular-devkit/build-angular:prerender` instead.
