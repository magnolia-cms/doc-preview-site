# Hello Magnolia

In this beginner tutorial, you create a simple web page based on a custom-built light module called `hello-magnolia`.

Your light module provides a page template and a custom `quotation` component for a web page. You will learn how to get content from a repository and display it on the page to make it look something like this:

![Final page view](../../_images/helloPage_final.png)

You will develop the page using [Magnolia CLI](#magnolia-cli:ROOT:index.adoc), an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com.adoc) package which facilitates light development with Magnolia.

Each page of the Hello Magnolia tutorial is tagged with the Hello Magnolia label to help you keep on track.

> **Tip:** You can browse or clone the publicly available example at public-doc-samples/hello-magnolia. Planning a headless project? Start with Get Started with Magnolia Headless instead.
