# Release notes for Magnolia CMS 6.3.12

> **Warning:** Do not upgrade to Magnolia 6.3.12 from Magnolia 6.3.8 and earlier.Upgrading to Magnolia 6.3.9, 6.3.10, 6.3.11, or 6.3.12 initiates a Marketing Tags version handler task that may cause instances to become unresponsive if the repository contains a large number of versions. See the Known issues page for more information.The issue has been resolved in the Magnolia 6.3.13 release.

We’ve released **Magnolia 6.3.12** to fix an issue found in Magnolia 6.3.11. This issue, related to ticket [MGNLREST-877](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLREST-877) (*Introduce JacksonContextResolver to consistent JSON serialization*), caused an unexpected change in the Nodes API, which may have impacted some REST API integrations. For more details, see [Magnolia 6.3.11 known issues](../Release-notes-for-Magnolia-CMS-6.3.11/Magnolia-6.3.11-known-issues/).

The 6.3.12 release reverts the problematic code from MGNLREST-877 to restore stability. All other improvements and updates from 6.3.11 remain unchanged and are detailed in the [Release notes for Magnolia CMS 6.3.11](../Release-notes-for-Magnolia-CMS-6.3.11/).

Thank you for your understanding. Contact our [Support team](#support:ROOT:index.adoc) if you need more information.
