# Tasks cleaner module

[Incubator](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/services/taskscleaner) Version 3.0.0 [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

The **Tasks cleaner module** provides commands for managing tasks like scheduled publications that have been executed.

Tasks that have been successfully executed are marked as "resolved" and retained in the task workspace in your JCR repository.

-   Resolved tasks can be marked as "archived" and will no longer be displaced in the Tasks app.

-   Archived tasks can be marked as "removed".


Having many resolved tasks can affect:

-   the time to log in to Admincentral

-   the time to publish


> **Note:** It’s a good idea to periodically archive resolved tasks to prevent Admincentral performance from being adversely impacted.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven
