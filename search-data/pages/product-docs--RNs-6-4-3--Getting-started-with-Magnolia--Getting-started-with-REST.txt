# Getting started with REST

REST endpoints enable other software to get real, raw content directly from Magnolia. This is how mobile apps, front-end JavaScript apps, or systems, like e-commerce or banking systems, can connect with Magnolia. With our out-of the-box [delivery endpoint](../../../../rest/api/delivery-endpoint/), this is easy and fast to set up, more powerful and more performant than ever.

This beginner’s tutorial is intended for developers who want to start using Magnolia REST features.

## [](#_setting_up_magnolia_for_rest)Setting up Magnolia for REST

In this section, you use [Magnolia CLI](../../../../magnolia-cli/) to install and start a [preconfigured Magnolia bundle](../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/#_list_of_webapps) with the required modules for Magnolia REST features.

If you don’t have Magnolia CLI, install it as described [Getting started: Installing CLI](../../../../magnolia-cli/getting-started/#_installing_cli). Then, install Magnolia as follows:

1.  Change to the directory where you want to install the Magnolia bundle. In our example, we use the directory `~/dev/mgnl-rest-test`:

    ```console
    cd ~/dev/mgnl-rest-test
    ```

2.  Execute the Magnolia CLI `jumpstart` command to get Magnolia and choose the `demo-webapp` and the `magnolia-community-demo-webapp` templates when prompted:

    ```console
    mgnl -- jumpstart
    ```

    Jumpstart downloads and extracts the `travel-demo-community-webapp` and a Tomcat server.

    The following folders and files are created:

    ```console
    mgnl-rest-test/
    ├── apache-tomcat/
    ├── light-modules/
    ├── mgnl.config.js
    ├── mgnl.error.log
    ├── node_modules/
    ├── package-lock.json
    └── package.json
    ```

3.  In the `mgnl-rest-test` directory, execute the Magnolia CLI `start` command:

    ```console
    mgnl start
    ```

    When starting for the first time, Magnolia runs a web update and automatically installs all its modules.

4.  In your preferred browser, open the URL [http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor/](http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor/) and log in as user `superuser` with the password `superuser`.

5.  Have a look around Magnolia. Access the public instance with the URL [http://localhost:8080/magnoliaPublic/](http://localhost:8080/magnoliaPublic/).


### [](#_security_settings)Security settings

REST endpoints are a powerful tool but can also make your site very vulnerable. Make sure you understand how to implement a strong security strategy to safeguard your system.

> **Tip:** Before enabling and using the REST endpoints in a production environment, get familiar with the REST security topic.

In the context of this tutorial and to get started quickly, we use *users* with *roles* provided by the default setup of the Magnolia bundle:

-   the `superuser`, the account you log in with to the author instance, has:

    -   Read/Write access for the `/*` path on every JCR workspace, granted by the `superuser` role.

    -   Web access for the HTTP GET and POST methods for the `/.rest/*` path, granted by the `rest-admin` role, and for the `/*` path, granted by the `superuser` role.



## [](#_using_the_delivery_endpoint)Using the delivery endpoint

The [delivery endpoint](../../../../rest/api/delivery-endpoint/) is a REST API provided by Magnolia out-of-the-box. Use it for obtaining JCR data as JSON.

With version 2 of the Delivery API, you can define multiple endpoint configurations, deliver localized content and resolve references to nodes of other workspaces including assets and asset renditions.

You must provide at least one [endpoint configuration](../../../../rest/api/delivery-endpoint/#_configuration) to use the delivery API.

### [](#_configuring_the_endpoint)Configuring the endpoint

We will create a [light module](../../Modules/Light-modules/) to provide the YAML-based configuration required for the delivery endpoint.

> **Note:** The folder structure and endpoint definition configuration file names you create now may later be used as the value of the endpointPath property. The endpoint path is used as part of the URL so we recommend you think ahead when naming your files.

In your `light-modules` folder, which is configured with the `magnolia.resources.dir` property, create the following structure:

```text
define-delivery-endpoint/
└── restEndpoints/
    └── delivery/
        └── demo-content.yaml
```

Use this code to start with for the `demo-content.yaml` file:

demo-content.yaml

```yaml
$type: jcrDeliveryEndpoint_v2
workspace: website
depth: 2
nodeTypes:
  - mgnl:page
  - mgnl:area
  - mgnl:component
childNodeTypes:
  - mgnl:area
  - mgnl:component
```

You can find a full explanation of the properties on [Delivery endpoint API configuration](../../../../rest/api/delivery-endpoint/#_configuration).

### [](#_requesting_website_content)Requesting website content

With the configuration provided above, you are ready to send REST requests as `superuser` to your Magnolia author instance.

For example, try to retrieve the content of the `/travel/about` page on the `website` workspace.

> **Note:** Have a look at Delivery endpoint API: Read node to understand how to compose the URL.

For this particular case, you need to use a URL that contains:

-   The endpoint path: `delivery/demo-content`.

-   The relative path of the node: `travel/about`.


The URL should then contain `/.rest/delivery/demo-content/travel/about`.

Next, add the `context` (the name of the webapp), the domain and the protocol, and you get this URL: `http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor/.rest/delivery/demo-content/travel/about`.

You are ready to test the endpoint, for example with cURL. Execute the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor/.rest/delivery/demo-content/travel/about' \
-u superuser:superuser
```

## [](#_additional_examples)Additional examples

The examples below show how to get content from the out-of-the-box `tours_v1` delivery endpoint in our [public demo](https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/).

> **Tip:** Mozilla Firefox includes a JSON viewer you can use to view the responses in a more human-friendly format.

-   **Get all content**. Get all the tours published to the public demo site:

    [`.rest/delivery/tours/v1`](https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/.rest/delivery/tours/v1)

-   **Get a specific item**. Retrieve a specific tour published to the demo site by providing a concrete path:

    [`.rest/delivery/tours/v1/magnolia-travels/A-Taste-of-Malaysia`](https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/.rest/delivery/tours/v1/magnolia-travels/A-Taste-of-Malaysia)

-   **Full text search**. Run a full text search for `landscape` in all the tours:

    [`.rest/delivery/tours/v1/?q=landscape`](https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/.rest/delivery/tours/v1/?q=landscape)

-   **Using filters**. Filter content on the `isFeatured` property and `duration` of seven days:

    [`.rest/delivery/tours/v1/?isFeatured=true&duration=7`](https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/.rest/delivery/tours/v1/?isFeatured=true&duration=7)

-   **Limiting results**. Get tour content limited to five results and offset to begin at the number `10`:

    [`.rest/delivery/tours/v1/?limit=5&offset=10`](https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/.rest/delivery/tours/v1/?limit=5&offset=10)

-   **Specific locale**. Get all content in a specific language (German) from a sub-resource:

    [`.rest/delivery/tours/v1/?lang=de-DE`](https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/.rest/delivery/tours/v1/?lang=de-DE)
