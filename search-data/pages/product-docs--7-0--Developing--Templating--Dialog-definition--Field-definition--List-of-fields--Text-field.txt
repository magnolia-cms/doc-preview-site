| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `maxLength` | **optional** , *default is -1* Maximum number of characters allowed in the field. Value of `-1` means unlimited. A counter below the field shows how many characters you have left. |
| `placeholder` | **optional** Placeholder text to be displayed when the field is empty. The value is [i18n](../../../../../../Administration/Language/Internationalization/#_i18n_message_keys) -able. |
| `rows` | **optional** Number of rows in the field. When set to a value greater than `1` , a [text area](https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/components/components-textarea.html) is rendered. |
| `valueChangeTimeout` | **optional** , *default is 400* The pause length (in milliseconds) while editing the text field before changes are sent to the server. The timeout may help to reduce the number of validations and requests, particularly the following. • Costly field validations on the server side. • Extensive [data source text filtering](../../../../../../Apps/App-configuration/Column-definition/#_columns_with_filter_definitions) requests. |
