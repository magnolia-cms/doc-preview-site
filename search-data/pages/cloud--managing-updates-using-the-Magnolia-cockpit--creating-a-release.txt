# Creating a release

A [release](../../Cockpit/Magnolia-cockpit-concepts/#_Siterelease) wraps the latest changes in the Integration environment in preparation for promotion on the UAT or Live environment. A new release contains all the Integration environment snapshots promoted since the last release was created. All releases are stored by Magnolia in the cloud and you can restore a previous version if you need to.

> **Important:** Before you can create a release at least one snapshot must be deployed in the Integration environment.When a deployed snapshot has been created as a release you cannot create another release until you deploy another snapshot.
