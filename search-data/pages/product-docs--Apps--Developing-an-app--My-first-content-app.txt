# My first content app

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating a content app in Magnolia. The app you create is called the Bookshelf app and you create it as a Magnolia [light module](../../../Modules/Light-modules/) from a custom [content type](../../../Features/Content-Types/) definition.

* * *

## [](#_tutorial_overview)Tutorial overview

The tutorial consists of three parts:

-   Part I - My first content app – This page, which describes the Bookshelf app.

-   [Part II - Creating a basic content app](Part-II---Creating-a-basic-content-app/) – Shows how to create the basic Bookshelf app from a content type definition.

-   [Part III - Fine-tuning a basic content app](Part-III---Fine-tuning-a-basic-content-app/) – Provides instructions to turn the basic app into the final and ready-to-use Bookshelf app.


Going through the tutorial you learn:

-   How to define content types and use them to quickly create *a Content app*.

    A Content app is a specialized app type for managing structured content. The content app user interface consists of a browser subapp and one or more detail subapps. Content apps make it easy to enter items such as products or events. Many native Magnolia apps such as [Tours](../../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Demo/) and [Contacts](../../List-of-apps/Contacts-app/) are content apps. Because this app style is used often, the framework provides convenience classes to make building a content app faster.

-   The basics of configuring [fields](../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/) and setting [field validators](../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/Field-validators/).

-   How to [override](../../../Developing/Reusing-configuration/YAML-inherit-and-include/#_yaml_override) configuration properties.

-   How to make the elements of the app’s UI ready for [internationalization](../../../Administration/Language/Internationalization/).


> **Note:** If you want to skip the tutorial and install the final app immediately, clone the repository containing the ready-made Bookshelf app as a light module directly into your Magnolia light module folder with the command:git clone -b master --single-branch https://bitbucket.org/magnolia-cms/bookshelf.gitYou can also browse or clone the publicly available example at public-doc-samples/bookshelf.

## [](#_bookshelf_app_use_case)Bookshelf app use case

The Bookshelf app you create in this tutorial is an example of a content app. It is a simple book catalog allowing the user to store basic bibliographic data about each book such as its title, the names of the author(s), the publisher’s name, or the ISBN-13 number. The app also allows you to group selected book items into folders called *shelves* in the app.

### [](#_the_subapps_in_the_bookshelf_app)The subapps in the Bookshelf app

The Bookshelf app contains subapps:

-   [Book Browser](#_book_browser)

-   [Book Detail](#_book_detail)


#### [](#_book_browser)Book Browser

In the **Book Browser** subapp, you can:

-   Browse the book catalog.

-   Add, rename and delete books.

-   Add, rename and delete shelves (folders for organizing books).


#### [](#_book_detail)Book Detail

The **Book Detail** subapp is a place where you can create and edit a book’s bibliographic properties using [text](../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Text-field/) fields and a [checkbox](../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Checkbox-field/) field.

### [](#_book_properties)Book properties

For each book item, the Bookshelf app can store and retrieve the following content properties:

-   Short cataloging name (a required content property).

-   Full book title.

-   Author(s)' name(s).

-   Whether the author(s) role is editorial or not.

-   Book description.

-   Publisher’s name.

-   Book publication date.

-   ISBN-13 number.


## [](#_bookshelf_app_and_magnolia_content_types)Bookshelf app and Magnolia content types

The Bookshelf app is based on Magnolia content types.

### [](#_the_books_workspace)The `books` workspace

Magnolia stores content in the `magnolia` repository, a [JCR repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository_API_for_Java) that is divided into [workspaces](../../../Administration/Architecture/Workspaces/). The Bookshelf app stores all books in a new workspace called `books`.

### [](#_custom_libbook_node_type)Custom `lib:book` node type

In the `books` workspace, each book is a custom `lib:book` [node type](../../../Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) defined specifically for this tutorial.
