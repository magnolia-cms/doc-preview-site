# AI Accelerator module

[Generative AI](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/generative-ai/) Unbundled: Extension Version 4.0-alpha [Magnolia 6.4](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

The AI Accelerator module integrates with leading generative AI providers such as OpenAI (ChatGPT), Azure AI, AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini, and Fal.ai, to save time and energy for marketers and other editors throughout the content lifecycle, from planning and creation through to content optimization, classification, and rollouts of personalized content.

## [](#_bring_your_own_model)Bring your own model

The AI Accelerator module enables you to choose and switch between AI providers and models. You maintain full control over which AI services you use, allowing you to:

-   Choose the best model for each task from multiple providers

-   Switch providers or models as your needs evolve

-   Avoid vendor lock-in and maintain flexibility

-   Comply with your organization’s data governance and security requirements

-   Use multiple providers simultaneously for different use cases


This open approach ensures you’re never tied to a single vendor and can adapt as the AI landscape evolves.
