# Editing pages

Use the Pages app to create and edit pages on a Magnolia author instance. When you are done editing, publish the changes to public instances.

## [](#_toolbars)Toolbars

Green toolbars identify editable page elements:

-   **Area bars** are containers. Click the bar to add a component in the area.

    ![Empty Main area bar](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/authoring/main-area-bar.png)

-   **Component bars** allow you to edit and move page components within an area.

## [](#_templates)Templates

Pages are based on templates. A template gives the page structure which is important for presenting content in the right order and building a consistent looking site. A template defines what components editors can create, edit and move on the page. They also define how many components are allowed in a particular area of the page. Without a template it would be difficult to keep the site design consistent.

See [Templating](../../Developing/Templating/) for more details.

## [](#_components)Components

Components are the smallest blocks of editable content. At its simplest, a component consists of a heading and some text but can contain almost anything.

-   To add a component, select an area first and click **Add component** in the action bar.

-   To duplicate a component, select it and click **Duplicate component** in the action bar.

-   To move a component, drag it above another component in the same area.

-   To delete a component, select it and click **Delete component** in the action bar.

-   There are two items that you can copy to the clipboard using the **Copy item** action in the list of actions on the right-hand side:

    1.  An area, including all the components within the area

    2.  A component


-   To paste copied component(s), click **Paste item** .

    1.  If you select an *area* before pasting, the copied item is pasted at the end of the area.

    2.  If you select a *component* before pasting, it’s inserted immediately after the selected component.

        You can paste a component multiple times by repeating the procedure.



> **Note:** If you want to copy a component from one area to another, the component must be available in the target area for the paste operation to work. Any component added to a page or duplicated remains selected for further editorial actions.

### [](#_remember_my_last_location)Remember my last location

Magnolia memorizes your last selection when you add [link fields](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Link-field/) to your content and reopens the chooser dialog in the correct location across content apps.

For example, if you add a **Text and Image** component to a page and select an image from the Asset chooser dialog, the selector memorizes the location of the image you select. When you go to add another image, the selector is automatically set on the image you selected previously.

The remember my last location functionality works per browser session so if you change to another tab, the location is reset.

## [](#_dialogs)Dialogs

In Magnolia, you edit content in a dialog. A dialog typically contains a form. Editors type content into the form fields and the dialog stores the content in the repository. You can create your own dialogs.

## [](#_previewing_pages)Previewing pages

Click **Preview page** to see the page without toolbars.

Use the slider to see the edit and preview views.

### [](#_preview_on_tablet_and_smartphone)Preview on tablet and smartphone

Use the dropdown at the bottom to switch between desktop, or tablet and smartphone in both landscape and portrait view. The resolution of the non-desktop options display in the bar. The resolutions are some of the most common device sizes on the market.

### [](#_preview_in_a_separate_tab)Preview in a separate tab

In the lower-right corner, you can click the **Preview in tab** button to open the current page in a new tab showing it *not* surrounded by the page editor.

![Pages app page preview in new tab](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/authoring/pages-app-preview-in-tab.png)

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Published | Content is published from the author instance to the public instance. Identical content exists on both instances. |
| Modified | Content was modified since publication. The author instance isn’t in sync with the public. |
| Draft | Content exists only on the author instance. |
| Marked for deletion | Content is marked for deletion but still appears in the list (grayed out). It can be restored or permanently deleted. |

## [](#_working_together)Working together

The number of concurrent editors is displayed at the bottom of the page editor. Click the icon to see who is editing the same page.

![Tour preview with the number of users editing the page at the bottom](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2_soft-locking_collaborating-users.png)

If users leave the page or new users start editing the page, the icon showing currently active users is updated accordingly. Additionally, notification messages are displayed in certain situations:

-   When another user saves their changes.

    ![Notification message](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2_soft-locking_reload-page.png)

-   If the page is moved.

-   If the page is deleted.


> **Note:** When multiple people edit the same dialog simultaneously, the last change made by any editor overrides all previous changes. For example, Jane and Eric open a dialog to update page content, making changes concurrently. Jane is the last person to save changes, so her changes overwrite those from Eric.
