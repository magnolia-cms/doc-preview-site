# Preventing DDoS attacks

To prevent and mitigate [DDoS attacks](https://www.fastly.com/products/ddos-mitigation), DX Cloud grants all customers (using Fastly as their CDN):

-   Access to origin shielding

    Origin shielding is designed to reduce the load on an origin server by centralizing cache fill operations to a limited set of CDN locations. For more details, see [Shielding](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/guides/concepts/shielding/).

-   Automatic resistance to availability attacks

-   Access to Fastly cache IP space

-   Custom DDoS filter creation abilities


> **Tip:** Learn more at Fastly’s Always-on DDos Mitigation page.

![block ip flow](../../cockpit/_images/cdn/block-ip-flow.svg)

1.  If you are using Fastly as your CDN in your DX Cloud project, you can block IPs directly from the cockpit. Cool, huh?

    > **Tip:** Check out the instructions for doing that here.

2.  If you are *not* using Fastly as your CDN, you’ll need to manually block the dangerous IP in the `ingress` section of your [values.yml](../../deployment/webapp_deployment/#_the_values_yml_file) file.


### [](#_instructions)Instructions

1.  Go to https://ipinfo.io/www.xxx.yyy.zzz (where `www.xxx.yyy.zzz` is the suspicious IP).

    ![ipinfo report abuse](../../_images/security/ddos/ipinfo-report-abuse.jpg)

2.  Update your [values.yml](../../deployment/webapp_deployment/#_the_values_yml_file) file with the following snippet:

    ```yaml
    kind: Ingress (1)
    metadata:
      annotations:
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: deny www.xxx.yyy.zzz; (2)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Specifies the kind `Ingress`. |
    | **2** | Denies the specific IP address. |

    > **Caution:** Only use the `server-snippet` exactly as instructed. Otherwise, you may cause issues with your PaaS deployment.
