# How to migrate Adobe credentials from JWT to OAuth Server-to-Server

Adobe has deprecated Service Account (JWT) credentials in favor of the new OAuth Server-to-Server credentials.

While the Service Account (JWT) credentials have been marked as deprecated, they will continue to work until January 27, 2025. Therefore, you must migrate your application or integration to use the new OAuth Server-to-Server credential before January 27, 2025.

For Adobe information about the benefits of migrating, the deprecation timeline, and how to migrate, see [https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/migration/](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/migration/)

To migrate:

1.  Follow the [migration documentation provided by Adobe](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/migration/) to create your OAuth Server-to-Server credentials in the Adobe Developer Console.

2.  Update the following properties in your `adobeDataSupplier.yaml` data supplier .yaml file with the migrated values:

    -   `clientId`

    -   `clientSecret`

    -   `scope`

    -   `orgId`

    -   `technicalAccountId`

    -   `imsExchange`


3.  Remove the following properties used by the JWT:

    -   `metascopes`

    -   `tokenExpTime`

    -   `privateKeyPath`



> **Tip:** For information about creating the OAuth Server-to-Server credentials in a new project, see Accessing Adobe Client Credentials in the Adobe Analytics section.

Example of a migrated configuration file: `adobe-analytics/dataSuppliers/adobeDataSupplier.yaml`

```yaml
