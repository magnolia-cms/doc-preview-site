## [](#_swift_publication)Swift publication

Swift publication offers a more scalable and efficient method for versioning and publishing content than the default DX Core [publishing](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Publishing/) workflow. It is delivered as a standalone enterprise module that can be used as a drop-in replacement for DX Core publishing. It requires the provisioning of additional infrastructure (an external version store and a message broker).

[Swift publication](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Modules/List-of-modules/Swift-publication.adoc) stores versions in an external version store, such as S3. You can use REST to communicate between author and public instances. When an author publishes changes, the changes are sent to and stored in the external version store. The public instances receive notifications via REST and fetch the corresponding version from the version store.

This architecture provides a couple of advantages over the default DX Core publication process:

-   There is less load on the author instance as versions are maintained externally

-   Better and more flexible scalability regarding the size and frequency of publications, as well as the number of public instances

-   Improved resilience and easier failure recovery

-   Simple transactionality model (eventual consistency amongst public instances)


> **Note:** Remember, these benefits come with the added complexity of provisioning, configuring, and maintaining the external version store. For smaller sites, you might not consider the extra effort justified.
