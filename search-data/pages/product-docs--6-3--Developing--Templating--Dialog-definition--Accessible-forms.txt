# Accessible forms (tech preview)

## [](#_viewing_accessible_forms)Viewing accessible forms

Accessible forms use the existing Magnolia [form definitions](../) but don’t support every field or every property. When a form definition is fully supported, the new accessible form is displayed. Otherwise, the system will *fall back* to the standard Vaadin form. In this case, problems are shown in the Definitions app to indicate which features aren’t supported in the new UI. Set the new **Problem type** filter to `UNSUPPORTED` or `IGNORED` to see them.

Support for more fields is in development, but not all of the current behavior will be supported. To streamline the product, we’ll remove some rarely used features. See [Current and planned support](#_current_and_planned_support) for more details.

## [](#_how_to_try_accessible_forms)How to try accessible forms

There are a few different options to get started with the new forms.

Email us at [feedback@magnolia-cms.com](mailto:feedback@magnolia-cms.com) to book a live demo, and share your feedback with us directly.

### [](#_local_installation)Local installation

The feature requires Magnolia `6.4.0-beta1`.

We recommend one of the following installation routes.

-   **Build with Maven**

    1.  Create a `6.4.0-beta1` DX Core [custom webapp](../../../Bundles-and-webapps/Creating-a-custom-webapp-with-Maven/). The `warp-forms` is included automatically together with the DX Core dependencies.

    2.  Run the created webapp in a Jakarta-compatible Tomcat (`10.1.43+`).


-   **Install the released Tomcat bundle**

    -   Download a full webapp bundled with the Tomcat:

        > **Note:** This option requires a DX Core license.

        1.  Sign in to [Magnolia Nexus](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/).

        2.  Download and install the [magnolia-dx-core-webapp-6.4.0-alpha1-tomcat-bundle](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/repository/magnolia.enterprise.releases/info/magnolia/dx/magnolia-dx-core-webapp/6.4.0-alpha1/magnolia-dx-core-webapp-6.4.0-alpha1-tomcat-bundle.zip) (ZIP archive).




#### [](#_add_the_demo_project_and_try_it_out)Add the demo project and try it out

There’s a demo project called `demo-warp-forms`, which demonstrates all of the features so far implemented in Accessible forms.

-   Download the [demo project](https://bitbucket.org/magnolia-cms/demo-warp-forms) and copy the `demo-warp-forms-lm` directory into your configured `magnolia.resources.dir` directory (into the `light-modules` directory).

-   Start your Magnolia instance.

-   Open the **Cakes app** and create a new item to try out the Accessible forms.


## [](#_possible_issues_in_the_beta1)Possible issues in the beta1

### [](#_determine_why_a_form_is_displaying_vaadin_forms)Determine why a form is displaying Vaadin forms

Are you seeing Vaadin forms instead of the new Warp forms?

-   Open the Definitions app, and switch to the **Problems** subapp.

-   Use the new **Problem type** filter and choose `UNSUPPORTED`.

-   You will now see the problems causing the form to display the Vaadin form.


See [Current and planned support](#_current_and_planned_support) for details on which features we still plan to support in the future.

### [](#_check_which_properties_are_being_ignored)Check which properties are being ignored

Open the Definitions app, and switch to the **Problems subapp**. Use the new **Problem type** filter and choose `IGNORED`.

If it’s important for you that these properties are used in the form and not ignored, you can force a form to be displayed in Vaadin by setting the `$type` of the form to `vaadinForm`.

```yaml
...
    detail:
        label: My App detail
        form:
            $type: vaadinForm
            properties:
...
```

See [Current and planned support](#_current_and_planned_support) for a full list of which properties are ignored.

### [](#_see_all_the_problems_of_a_form)See all the problems of a form

In the **Problems subapp**, only the first problem of each definition is displayed. To see all the problems of a form, check the checkbox on the left to select the problem and use the **Export problems** action in the Action bar. A text file will be exported.

### [](#_use_accessible_forms_and_vaadin_forms_in_parallel)Use Accessible forms and Vaadin forms in parallel

Even once the Accessible forms feature is released, not every form will be supported due to the many custom fields included in extensions or customer projects. There will be a transition period. You can continue to use Vaadin forms and upgrade them to Accessible forms as appropriate.
