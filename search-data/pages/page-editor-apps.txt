# Page-editor apps extension

[Content management](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/content-management/) Unbundled: [Extension](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/#_module_types) [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/6.3/) compatible License: [DX Core](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/License/#_dx_core){frameworks-and-extensions-license-note}

## [](#_overview)Overview

With this extension, you can create custom apps which use the Visual Page Editor.

You’ve always been able to create content apps and stories apps for your projects. Now, you can create additional apps that behave like the stock [Pages app](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Pages-app/): apps with the Visual Page Editor and templating features.

> **Note:** Current limitationsLive copy isn’t supported.Personalization isn’t supported.

## [](#_use_cases)Use cases

### [](#_channel_apps)Channel apps

Create custom Page-editor apps to manage channels other than your websites. For example, create Page-editor apps for channels such as:

-   IoT

-   Blogs

-   Digital signage

-   Extranets

-   Kiosks

-   Mobile phones

-   Point of sale

-   Portals


#### [](#_easier_channel_management)Easier channel management

All of those channels could also be managed in the stock Pages app, but it’s more intuitive for authors when each channel has a dedicated app.

-   You can even configure that only the authors with access to a channel can see the app, simplifying the UI for them.

-   You could also group your websites into different custom channel apps to help with organization.


### [](#_customized_uis)Customized UIs

A custom Page-editor app also helps when you want to show a different browser view than displayed in the stock Pages app.

You can provision:

-   Different columns or column order.

-   Different filtering tools.

-   Different actions.


For example, you could create an SEO app for the SEO experts that shows many more columns than in the stock Pages app. Yet authoring users can still use the stock Pages app.

> **Note:** The channel apps and customized UI use cases can also be combined.
