# Cloudinary External DAM module introduction

[Digital asset management (DAM)](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) Unbundled: Extension Version 3.0.2 [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

The **Cloudinary External DAM module** provides an app which allows Magnolia users to access and leverage assets that are managed with their Cloudinary service as if they were natively part of Magnolia.

Cloudinary is an image and video management cloud-based platform that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for uploading, storing, managing, transforming, and delivering digital assets. It simplifies handling media files for websites and applications, which allows developers to focus on building engaging user experiences rather than managing infrastructure.

Once installed, there is some basic configuration. Marketers can then browse, add, and remove images. They get a dialog to use images or videos within their website, using a unified workflow across the two systems and an editorial experience that feels Magnolia native.

## [](#_license)License

The Cloudinary External DAM module was previously an incubator module. It is now a fully supported [extension](../product-docs/6.3/Modules/#_module_types) since Magnolia 6.3 and requires a special license.
