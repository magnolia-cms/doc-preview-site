# Backend Live - Javascript Commands

TODO

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

your-webapp-maven-project/pom.xml

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.backendlive</groupId>
  <artifactId>backend-live-commands</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## [](#_installing_to_a_bundle)Installing to a Bundle

If you have an existing bundle, perhaps obtained by using the Magnolia CLI, you will need to add the modules as defined at [Javascript Models 2.0](../../javascript-models/#_installing_to_a_bundle), as well as its dependencies to each webapp’s `/WEB-INF/lib` directories:

[Backend Live Commands JAR](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/service/local/repositories/magnolia.forge.releases/content/info/magnolia/backendlive/backend-live-commands/1.1.0/backend-live-commands-1.1.0.jar)

Using a standard Magnolia Bundle, these directories would be:

-   `apache-tomcat/webapps/magnoliaAuthor/WEB-INF/lib/`

-   `apache-tomcat/webapps/magnoliaPublic/WEB-INF/lib/`


| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `cmsfn` | Navigate content and create links. |
| `damfn` | Get assets and renditions and create links to assets. |
| `sitefn` | Get sites and themes. |
| `imgfn` | Get links to images from any workspace. |
| `resfn` | Create links to css and js files by given patterns. |
| `restfn` | Access REST clients. |
| `searchfn` | Search pages and content. |

### [](#_samples)Samples

There are light-module samples for each of the projects found in our [Backend-Live Samples](https://git.magnolia-cms.com/projects/LIGHT-MODULES/repos/backend-live-samples/browse) repository.

Once you check out the project, you can simply copy the `light-modules/backend-live-commands-lm` folder into your `magnolia.resources.dir` location (defined in `YOUR-WEB-APP/WEB-INF/config/default/magnolia.properties`).

If you are interested in a more complex demonstration, and tutorial on how to use multiple extensions in conjunction with each other, you may be interested in checking out our [Backend Live Demo](https://git.magnolia-cms.com/projects/LIGHT-MODULES/repos/backend-live-demo/browse) project.
