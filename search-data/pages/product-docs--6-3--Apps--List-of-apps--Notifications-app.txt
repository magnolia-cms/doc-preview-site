# Notifications app

The Notifications app provides users with relevant runtime information about the system. To open the app, click the arrow next to **Notifications** in the upper-right corner.

The notification counter shows only new notifications. A green dot only appears next to the counter if there are unread notifications.

You can sort notifications by clicking any of the column headers. In the **Type** column, you can filter notifications by [type](#_notification_types).

## [](#_notification_types)Notification types

The app displays the following notification types:

-   ![Error icon](../../../_images/6-0-errorIcon.gif) **Error**: Reports severe problems that have occurred (typically system errors).

-   ![Info icon](../../../_images/6-0-infoIcon.gif) **Info**: Informs the user about changes.

-   ![Warning icon](../../../_images/6-0-warningIcon.gif) **Warning**: Warns the user about conditions requiring attention or intervention.


## [](#_notification_banners)Notification banners

When you are working in Magnolia apps, notifications pop up as [banners](../../Developing-an-app/Specific-aspects/Messages/Message-types/#_banners) below the [Find bar](../../../Authoring/Search/Searching-for-content/). The following are the banner types:

-   **Error**
