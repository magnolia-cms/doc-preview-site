# Digital asset management (DAM)

![useCase dam](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/features/useCase-dam.jpg)

Magnolia excels in digital asset management (DAM), offering standard features alongside seamless integration with common DAM tools. The platform provides excellent capabilities for organizing, storing, and retrieving digital assets efficiently. Magnolia’s flexibility extends to our compatibility with popular DAM tools, ensuring easy integration and interoperability.

The inclusion of useful modules, such as tagging, enhances the organization and discoverability of digital assets. This allows users to apply metadata and tags, streamlining the search and retrieval process. Whether leveraging our native DAM features or integrating with external tools, Magnolia provides a comprehensive solution for managing digital assets, catering to the diverse needs of users working with rich media content.

Our Digital asset management (DAM) stores all assets in one centralized location.

You can view, [manage](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Managing-assets/) and [edit](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Editing-images/) assets in the Assets app. You can use assets on pages and create links to them.

## [](#_features)Features

Assets stored in the DAM can be used on Web pages, for example, to display an image on the page or to link to a downloadable document.

-   **Bulk upload** multiple assets at once, including .zip files to maintain folder structure and simplify batch imports.

-   **Store** all media types (image, video, audio, Flash, documents) in one place.

-   **Use** assets on Web pages and in custom content types.

-   **Edit** images.

-   **Tag** images. Image content is [recognized](../../../../image-recognition/) automatically upon image upload and description [tags](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Tags-module/) attached to an image.

-   **Metadata**. By default, the DAM supports the [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/) metadata standard. Additional standards can be added.

-   **Control access** to assets and the editing functionality.


The DAM provides effective asset management and basic editing features. It is not intended to replace media tools that feature archiving and advanced edit functionality. The focus is on a convincing, consistent and easy-to-understand solution covering the everyday needs of companies running single or multiple websites with Magnolia.

> **Tip:** If you need more extensive asset management features, our External DAM integration framework provides out-of-the-box connectors for S3 and Bynder.You can also connect to another third-party tool by extending the DAM API.

## [](#_benefits)Benefits

The benefits of storing files in the DAM are:

-   **Centralization**: The DAM provides a centralized location for assets that can be used across different websites in a Magnolia instance.

-   **Re-use**: The same asset can be used in many locations of the site.

-   **Consistency**: Updating a single asset in the Assets app propagates to all pages where the asset is used.

-   **Standardization**: The same file properties are used each time the file is referenced. You can make the [metadata fields](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Managing-assets/#_asset_metadata) mandatory to ensure editors include relevant content.
