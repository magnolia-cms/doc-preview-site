## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.dam</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-dam-jcr-fastly</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.9</version>
</dependency>
```

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

Renditions are configured in the `config.yaml` file of the module. You can decorate it using a custom light module or use the Resources App to add more renditions. The renderer generates a link to the dam servlet adding in the query string parameters configured for the rendition.

> **Tip:** For more on asset renditions in Magnolia, see the DAM API’s AssetRenditions and MediaTypes.

config.yaml

```yaml
renditions:
  width-960: width=960&crop=16:9,smart (1)
  thumbnail: crop:1:1,smart&width=64 (2)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The link generated for the **width-960** rendition would be `/dam/jcr:78399215-aed5-4518-9cfc-9b39855f4740/ash-edmonds-441220-unsplash.jpg?width=960&crop=16:9,smart`. |
| **2** | The link generated for the **thumbnail** rendition would be `/dam/jcr:78399215-aed5-4518-9cfc-9b39855f4740/ash-edmonds-441220-unsplash.jpg?crop:1:1,smart&width=64`. |

### [](#_dynamic_renditions)Dynamic renditions

The module support dynamic renditions that does not need to be predefined. So if you try to obtain the following rendition **400x200**, it will generate a link using the parameters **width=400&height=200**.

The following related parameters can be configured too:

```yaml
enableDynamicRenditions: true (1)
extraDynamicRendition: crop:1:1,smart (2)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Setting `enableDynamicRenditions` to `false` will disable dynamic renditions. |
| **2** | In `extraDynamicRendition`, you can include any parameter that will be always used for generating dynamic renditions. For instance, having the above configuration, the rendition `400x200` will generate this link: `width=400&height=200&crop:1:1,smart`. |

### [](#_ignore_imaging)Ignore imaging

By default, if you try to use an undefined `rendition`, the renderer tries to use a rendition from Magnolia. If you want to always use the original image (from Magnolia) in these cases, you can configure the `ignoreImagingRenderer` property to `true`.

```yaml
ignoreImagingRenderer: true
```

### [](#_disable_for_author)Disable for author

By default, this module is disabled in the author server. If you want to enable it in the author server, you can set this property:

```yaml
disableForAuthor: false (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | If left undefined or set to `true`, the module will remain disabled for the **author** server. |

### [](#_safe_crop)Safe Crop

By default values for the crop area are respected, could be that it fall out of rendering area and the image is not rendered, in order to work around that and get the image rendered there is a flag `safeCrop` that can be set to true so the image is rendered although area might not be what was defined.

| Version | Notes |
