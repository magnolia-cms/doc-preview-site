# Installing Magnolia through npm CLI

This page explains how you can use npm CLI to install the Community Edition of Magnolia.

**Prerequisites**

|  | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| **Check for JAVA_HOME** | • Open the command prompt. • Type `set` and press `ENTER` . • Find `JAVA_HOME` in the command output and verify that the path points to your JDK installation directory, for example, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>>.xx` . • If `JAVA_HOME` is missing or it points to the wrong directory, see **Set JAVA_HOME** . |
| **Set JAVA_HOME** | • Open the Command Prompt as an administrator. • Set the path for `JAVA_HOME` . `setx /m JAVA_HOME "path\to\Java\jdk" (1)` ** **1** Where `path\to\Java\jdk` is where your Java Development Kit is saved. The `set` command creates the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and sets its value to the JDK directory. The command is executed when Magnolia starts. | ** **1** | Where `path\to\Java\jdk` is where your Java Development Kit is saved. |

## [](#_get_nodejs_and_npm)Get nodejs and npm

Magnolia CLI runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and *npm*, the Node.js package manager. Use the following two shell commands to check that you have both of them installed:

node -v
npm -v

If you do not have Node.js installed, go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), download and install the latest LTS version.

For installation instructions of npm, see [https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## [](#_get_magnolia_cli)Get Magnolia CLI

Run the following command in a shell to install [Magnolia CLI](../../../../../magnolia-cli/):

-   Mac or Linux

-   Windows


```console
sudo npm install @magnolia/cli -g
```

```console
npm install @magnolia/cli -g (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Depending on your permissions and the location where you have installed Node.js, you may have to execute the command above with root permissions. Without installation permissions you will notice messages such as `npm ERR!` in the shell. |

Once you have installed Magnolia CLI, test the installation by running the following command in the shell:

```console
mgnl help
```

## [](#_downloading_magnolia)Downloading Magnolia

Let’s assume that the directory where you intend to download and install Magnolia is called `magnolia`.

1.  Change to this directory and open a shell.

2.  Enter the following command, where with `<version>` you may specify the Magnolia release you wish to download.
    (If you don’t specify the version and run the command without the `-m` switch, CLI will download the latest release of the most recent Magnolia branch.

    ```none
    mgnl jumpstart -m <version>
    ```

3.  When prompted to choose templates, enter:

    -   `2` for the `demo-webapps` template,

    -   followed by either:

        -   `1` for the `magnolia-community-demo-webapp` or

        -   `2` for the `magnolia-dx-core-demo-webapp`, provided you got a valid Magnolia license.




The `jumpstart` command:

-   Downloads the Magnolia bundle specified into the `magnolia` directory.

-   installs and configures CLI v5.

-   Creates a `light-modules` folder in the directory.

-   Changes the default value of the `magnolia.resources.dir` configuration property from `${magnolia.home}/modules` to `/magnolia/light-modules` for both the Author and the Public instances of Magnolia.


Once the setup operation is complete, you should see a message similar to this one:

```console
info: Project successfully downloaded
info: Run "npm run mgnl" to see the list of registered commands
info: Start the project using: "npm run mgnl -- start"
info: If the "StartPlugin" is not available, install it using: "npm run mgnl -- add-plugin @magnolia/cli-start-plugin"
info: For additional plugins and features, refer to the Magnolia CLI documentation: https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/magnolia-cli
```

> **Caution:** Windows users using PowerShell must enclose the two consecutive hyphens (--) in quotes:npm run mgnl "--" ...

## [](#_starting_magnolia)Starting Magnolia

In the parent directory of `light-modules`, enter:

```console
npm run mgnl -- start
```

> **Caution:** Windows users using PowerShell must enclose the two consecutive hyphens (--) in quotes:npm run mgnl "--" ...

The command starts Magnolia. This is complete when you see a message like `Server startup in 112737 milliseconds`. You can then access the UI of the Author instance.

> **Caution:** If you set a new superuser password in a properties file before starting up a fresh installation, you must delete the password from the properties file. This is necessary to avoid a security vulnerability. Ensure any bootstrapped password is removed after logging in the first time.magnolia.properties...

Their passwords are not part of the bundle. For initial access, you may need to bootstrap passwords. After the first login, ensure that you remove these passwords from the properties file.

## [](#_logging_into_the_author_instance)Logging into the Author instance

Go to [`http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor`](http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor) and log in to the Author instance as a `superuser` :

-   Username: `superuser`

-   Password: `superuser`


The first page you see is the `App Launcher`, in which you can see groups of apps:

Congratulations. Magnolia is now installed and running.
