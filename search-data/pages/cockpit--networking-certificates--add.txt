# Add a Certificate

## [](#_managed)Managed

### [](#_name)Name

A unique identifier for your managed certificate. Must be a valid Kubernetes name (lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens allowed).

### [](#_key_size)Key Size

The cryptographic key algorithm and size for the certificate.

-   **RSA 2048** — Standard security, widely compatible.

-   **RSA 4096** — Higher security, larger key size.

-   **EC P-256** — Elliptic curve, efficient and secure.

-   **EC P-384** — Elliptic curve with higher security.


> **Tip:** RSA 2048 is sufficient for most use cases. Use EC P-256 for better performance with equivalent security.

### [](#_domain)Domain

The domain name for which the certificate will be issued. Must be a valid domain (e.g., `example.com` or `sub.example.com`).

### [](#_issuer)Issuer

The certificate issuer (Certificate Authority) that will sign your certificate. Only issuers configured with DNS01 solvers are available for managed certificates.

## [](#_custom)Custom

### [](#_name_2)Name

A unique identifier for your custom certificate. Must be a valid Kubernetes name (lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens allowed).

### [](#_key_size_2)Key Size

The cryptographic key algorithm and size for the Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

-   **RSA 2048** — Standard security, widely compatible.

-   **RSA 4096** — Higher security, larger key size.

-   **EC P-256** — Elliptic curve, efficient and secure.

-   **EC P-384** — Elliptic curve with higher security.


### [](#_alt_names)Alt Names

Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for the certificate. Add one or more domain names that the certificate should be valid for.

Supports wildcards (e.g., `*.example.com`) and standard domains.

SANs are the authoritative source for domain validation. Browsers do not use the Common Name field for certificate matching.

### [](#_common_name)Common Name

The primary domain name for the certificate, auto-populated from the first Alt Name.

Modern browsers ignore this field and use Alt Names (SANs) exclusively for domain validation. However, some legacy systems may still check this field.

For maximum compatibility, ensure the Common Name matches one of your Alt Names.

### [](#_organization)Organization

The legal name of your organization (optional). Appears in the certificate details.

### [](#_organizational_unit)Organizational Unit

The department or division within your organization (optional). For example: "IT Department" or "Engineering".

### [](#_locality)Locality

The city or locality where your organization is located (optional).

### [](#_state)State

The state or province where your organization is located (optional).

### [](#_country_name)Country Name

The two-letter ISO country code where your organization is located (optional). Select from the dropdown list.
