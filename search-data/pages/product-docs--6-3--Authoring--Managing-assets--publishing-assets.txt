# Publishing assets

Once you [upload your assets](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Managing-assets/uploading-assets/) in the asset chooser dialog, you can start adding them to pages and preview them on your author instance.

Make sure to click **Publish** in the action bar for all the assets that you want to appear on the public instance.

You can publish an individual asset, a folder, or multiple folders with all the assets they contain, or the assets you picked from different folders.

Your content is automatically versioned before it is published. See [Versioning](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Versioning/) for more information.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Published | Content is published from the author instance to the public instance. Identical content exists on both instances. |
| Modified | Content was modified since publication. The author instance isn’t in sync with the public. |
| Draft | Content exists only on the author instance. |
| Marked for deletion | Content is marked for deletion but still appears in the list (grayed out). It can be restored or permanently deleted. |

See [Publishing](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Publishing/) for more information on publishing options and the workflow.
