## [](#_global_password_policy_validation)Global password policy validation

The Admincentral module provides global password policy validation for all password fields via the ValidatingPasswordFieldDefinition class. This validation is configured in the `ui-framework-core` module and enforces password strength requirements across the system.

The default password policy requires:

-   Minimum 12 characters in length

-   At least one uppercase English letter

-   At least one lowercase English letter

-   At least one digit

-   At least one special character from the set: `#?!@$%^&*-`


This policy is automatically applied to password fields in the [Security app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/) and any other location where password validation is needed.

### [](#_configure_the_password_policy_pattern)Configure the password policy pattern

You can customize the password policy by decorating the `ui-framework-core` module configuration. The `pattern` property uses a regular expression to define password requirements.

To modify the password policy, create a decoration file in your module:

ui-framework-core/config.yaml

```yaml
...
  info.magnolia.ui.field.ValidatingPasswordFieldDefinition$BcryptedPasswordFieldDefinition:
    policy:
      class: info.magnolia.ui.field.RegexpValidatorDefinition
      # Password policy regular expression below:
      ## Password has a minimum of 12 characters in length. Adjust it by modifying {12,}
      ## At least one uppercase English letter. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[A-Z])
      ## At least one lowercase English letter. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[a-z])
      ## At least one digit. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[0-9])
      ## At least one special character. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-])
      pattern: ^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-]).{12,}$
```

You can customize the pattern by:

-   Changing the minimum length by modifying `{12,}` to your desired number

-   Removing character type requirements by deleting the corresponding `(?=.*?[…​])` groups

-   Adding additional special characters to the character set `[#?!@$%^&*-]`
