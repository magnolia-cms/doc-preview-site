# Receivers

In the context of the [Publishing module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Publishing-module/), *receiver* is usually a public Magnolia instance that receives content from an author instance.

This page explains how to configure receivers.

## [](#_about_the_publishing_process)About the publishing process

Publishing may refer either to a system process that copies content from an author to public instances or to a user action which triggers the process.

For more information about how publishing works, please refer to the [Publishing overview](../../Architecture/Publishing/) page.

## [](#_license_limitations)License limitations

-   The Community Edition supports one receiver. You can configure many receivers but only the first receiver will receive published content. The publishing process is handled by the Publishing module itself.

-   DX Core supports many receivers and the process is handled by the Publishing and Publishing Transactional modules.


## [](#_verifying_publication_success)Verifying publication success

There are three ways to verify successful publication:

-   Status indicator changes to green on the author instance.

-   Page content on the public instance is new. Request the page to test.

-   Publication log `/webapps/magnoliaAuthor/logs/magnolia-activation.log` contains a success entry. See [Monitoring](../../Monitoring/) about logging and debugging.


## [](#_configuration)Configuration

Publishing receivers are configured using MicroProfile Config. You can supply MicroProfile configurations using:

-   properties files

-   YAML files

-   system properties or environment variables (and more)


To point to your config file, you must pass the `magnolia.config.locations` as a system property (for example, using Tomcat VM options in the `setenv.sh` configuration file), pointing to the directory where your config file resides (for example `-Dmagnolia.config.locations=/opt/magnolia/mounted-config`).

-   microprofile-config.properties

-   microprofile-config.yaml


```properties
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].name=magnoliaPublic-0
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].url=http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-0-svc:8080
magnolia.publishing.receivers[1].name=magnoliaPublic-1
magnolia.publishing.receivers[1].url=http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-1-svc:8080
```

```yaml
magnolia:
  publishing:
    receivers:
      - name: magnoliaPublic-0
        url: http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-0-svc:8080
      - name: magnoliaPublic-1
        url: http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-1-svc:8080
```

> **Note:** The default receiver for local development (magnoliaPublic8080) has been removed.Receiver example for local developmentmagnolia.publishing.receivers[0].name=magnoliaPublic
> magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].url=http://{host}:{port}/magnoliaPublic (1)
> magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].enabled=true1Put the path magnoliaPublic in the URL for local development.

## [](#_previous_magnolia_6_2_definition_in_jcr)Previous (Magnolia 6.2) definition in JCR

In Magnolia 6.2, publishing receivers were configured in JCR, under the `publishing-core` module. This made it difficult to provision instances across multiple environments and configure receivers during installation or startup through various JCR *bootstrapping* techniques.

### [](#_receiver_properties)Receiver properties

 PropertyDescription

`name`

**required**

Disambiguating name for a specific receiving public instance.

`url`

**required**

Host name (or IP address) and port number of the receiving public instance.

`enabled`

**optional**, *default is `true`*

Enables or disables the receiver without deleting the setup.

> **Tip:** Useful when there are multiple receivers.

`connectionTimeout`

**optional**, *default is `10000` (10 seconds)*

Sets a connection timeout in milliseconds.

If time runs out before a connection to the receiver can be established, a `java.net.SocketTimeoutException` is thrown. The `0` value is interpreted as an infinite timeout.

`readTimeout`

**optional**, *default is `600000` (10 minutes)*

Sets the read timeout in milliseconds.

If time runs out before the published content is read from the author instance, a `java.net.SocketTimeoutException` is thrown. The `0` value is interpreted as an infinite timeout.

Receivers can receive any content item: websites, website sections, configuration settings, custom content types, forums, comments, documents, images and so on. For example, you could publish a campaign site to a dedicated public instance.

## [](#_troubleshooting_receivers_configuration)Troubleshooting receivers configuration

Use the following Groovy script to check your receivers are correctly configured.

```groovy
import info.magnolia.objectfactory.Components
import info.magnolia.publishing.config.PublishingConfig
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.Config
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider

config=ConfigProvider.getConfig()
println "Raw MP value: " + config.getValue("magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].url", String.class)

// Refreshable only via Guice for now, until MAGNOLIA-9367 standardizes the implementation.
Components.getComponent(PublishingConfig.class).getReceivers().get(0).getUrl()
```

## [](#_workspaces)Workspaces

> **Caution:** By default, a publishing receiver configuration will react to all workspaces.The purpose of these workspace configs is to react to specific workspaces in a more granular way, by excluding or including certain parts of the data.

For each receiver, the specific content to be published or excluded from publishing is configured through properties under the `workspaces` node.

Example MicroProfile configuration for the `website` workspace

```bash
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[0].workspace=website
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[0].fromPath=/
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[0].toPath=/
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[0].excluded=true
```

### [](#_example_a_reacting_to_a_workspace_partially)Example A - Reacting to a workspace partially

The receiver will react to the content in `/travel` in the `website` workspace, but will ignore everything else.

```bash
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[0].workspace=website
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[0].fromPath=/travel
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[0].toPath=/travel
```

### [](#_example_b_ignoring_a_workspace_partially)Example B - Ignoring a workspace partially

The receiver will ignore a specific path, here the `/sportstation`, but will react to everything else in the `website2` workspace.

```bash
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[1].workspace=website2
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[1].fromPath=/sportstation
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[1].toPath=/sportstation
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[1].excluded=true
```

### [](#_example_c_ignoring_a_complete_workspace)Example C - Ignoring a complete workspace

The receiver will not react at all to the `test-website` workspace.

```bash
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[2].workspace=test-website
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[2].fromPath=/
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[2].toPath=/
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].workspaces[2].excluded=true
```

## [](#_multiple_receivers)Multiple receivers

In DX Core, the author instance can publish content to multiple receivers. Receivers are key to building high-availability, load-balanced environments since they can be configured to receive targeted content. See [Creating a new public instance](../Creating-a-new-public-instance/).
