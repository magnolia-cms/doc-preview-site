# Receivers

In the context of the [Publishing module](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Publishing-module/), *receiver* is usually a public Magnolia instance that receives content from an author instance.

This page explains how to configure receivers.

## [](#_about_the_publishing_process)About the publishing process

Publishing may refer either to a system process that copies content from an author to public instances or to a user action which triggers the process.

For more information about how publishing works, please refer to the [Publishing overview](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Publishing/) page.

## [](#_license_limitations)License limitations

-   The Community Edition supports one receiver. You can configure many receivers but only the first receiver will receive published content. The publishing process is handled by the Publishing module itself.

-   DX Core supports many receivers and the process is handled by the Publishing and Publishing Transactional modules.


## [](#_verifying_publication_success)Verifying publication success

There are three ways to verify successful publication:

-   Status indicator changes to green on the author instance.

-   Page content on the public instance is new. Request the page to test.

-   Publication log `/webapps/magnoliaAuthor/logs/magnolia-activation.log` contains a success entry. See [Monitoring](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Monitoring/) about logging and debugging.


## [](#_configuration)Configuration

Publishing receivers are configured using MicroProfile Config. You can supply MicroProfile configurations using:

-   properties files

-   YAML files

-   system properties or environment variables (and more)


To point to your config file, you must pass the `magnolia.config.locations` as a system property (for example, using Tomcat VM options in the `setenv.sh` configuration file), pointing to the directory where your config file resides (for example `-Dmagnolia.config.locations=/opt/magnolia/mounted-config`).

-   microprofile-config.properties

-   microprofile-config.yaml


```properties
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].name=magnoliaPublic-0
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].url=http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-0-svc:8080
magnolia.publishing.receivers[1].name=magnoliaPublic-1
magnolia.publishing.receivers[1].url=http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-1-svc:8080
```

```yaml
magnolia:
  publishing:
    receivers:
      - name: magnoliaPublic-0
        url: http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-0-svc:8080
      - name: magnoliaPublic-1
        url: http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-1-svc:8080
```

> **Note:** The default receiver for local development (magnoliaPublic8080) has been removed.Receiver example for local developmentmagnolia.publishing.receivers[0].name=magnoliaPublic
> magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].url=http://{host}:{port}/magnoliaPublic (1)
> magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].enabled=true1Put the path magnoliaPublic in the URL for local development.

## [](#_troubleshooting_receivers_configuration)Troubleshooting receivers configuration

Use the following Groovy script to check your receivers are correctly configured.

```groovy
import info.magnolia.objectfactory.Components
import info.magnolia.publishing.config.PublishingConfig
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.Config
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider

config=ConfigProvider.getConfig()
println "Raw MP value: " + config.getValue("magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].url", String.class)

// Refreshable only via Guice for now, until MAGNOLIA-9367 standardizes the implementation.
Components.getComponent(PublishingConfig.class).getReceivers().get(0).getUrl()
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `workspace` | **required** Name of a workspace. |
| `fromPath` | **required** Workspace path on the author instance from which content is published. For a single site, enter the site node such as `/my-site` . To receive content from a particular branch, enter a more precise path such as `/my-site/about` . A trailing slash in the path limits the published content to the subnodes: • `/` - Everything • `/my-site` - The `/my-site` node and everything under it. • `/my-site/about` - The `about` node and everything under it. • `/my-site/about/` - Content under `/my-site/about` page but not the node itself. |
| `toPath` | **required** Workspace path on the public instance to which the content is published. |
| `enabled` | **optional** , *default is true* A Node2Bean property that turns the mapping on ( `true` ) or off ( `false` ). |
| `excluded` | **optional** , *default is false* The `true` setting excludes the configured `fromPath` from publication. This property allows you to define exceptions such as "Publish everything in the `website` workspace except the `about` node and everything under it." |

## [](#_multiple_receivers)Multiple receivers

In DX Core, the author instance can publish content to multiple receivers. Receivers are key to building high-availability, load-balanced environments since they can be configured to receive targeted content. See [Creating a new public instance](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Instances/Creating-a-new-public-instance/).
