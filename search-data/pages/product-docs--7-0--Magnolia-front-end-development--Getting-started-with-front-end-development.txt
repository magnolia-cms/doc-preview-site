# Getting started with front-end development

Magnolia supports two main approaches for building front-end applications:

-   **Headless development** using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue, with either client-side rendering or server-side rendering.

-   **FreeMarker-based development** for traditional server-side rendering using FreeMarker templates.


This guide walks you through setting up your environment and jumpstarting a project using the Magnolia CLI, whether you choose the headless or FreeMarker path.

## [](#_prerequisites_and_installation)Prerequisites and installation

Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary tools installed.

## [](#_get_node_js)Get node.js

Magnolia CLI is an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package providing a command line interface (CLI) tool to set up and facilitate light development with Magnolia. The Magnolia CLI tool runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you do not have Node.js installed, go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and download and install the latest LTS version.

To check the version of your node installation, run the following command in a shell:

node -v

| **Check for JAVA_HOME** | • Open the command prompt. • Type `set` and press `ENTER` . • Find `JAVA_HOME` in the command output and verify that the path points to your JDK installation directory, for example, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>>.xx` . • If `JAVA_HOME` is missing or it points to the wrong directory, see **Set JAVA_HOME** . |
| **Set JAVA_HOME** | • Open the Command Prompt as an administrator. • Set the path for `JAVA_HOME` . `setx /m JAVA_HOME "path\to\Java\jdk" (1)` ** **1** Where `path\to\Java\jdk` is where your Java Development Kit is saved. The `set` command creates the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and sets its value to the JDK directory. The command is executed when Magnolia starts. | ** **1** | Where `path\to\Java\jdk` is where your Java Development Kit is saved. |
| ** **1** | Where `path\to\Java\jdk` is where your Java Development Kit is saved. |

## [](#_using_magnolia_cli)Using Magnolia CLI

We recommend using [Magnolia CLI v5](https://mgnl.io/cli) to create and manage your front-end projects.

The CLI is a plugin-based tool that supports both FreeMarker and headless setups. It provides simple commands to build your project and manage its structure.

To simplify setup, install and run the CLI on a per-project basis. The CLI will take care of downloading and configuring everything for you.

## [](#_jumpstarting_a_project)Jumpstarting a Project

The `jumpstart` command is used for both FreeMarker and headless setups. It downloads the necessary Magnolia instance, configuration files, and optionally a front-end application based on your selection.

### [](#_using_the_jumpstart_command)Using the jumpstart command

To begin, create a new directory and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir magnolia-project
cd magnolia-project
```

Then run:

```bash
npx @magnolia/cli@latest jumpstart
```

You’re prompted to choose a project category and template.

The jumpstart command lets you create a Magnolia project with either:

-   A headless starter project and demo content

-   FreeMarker templates and demo content


Depending on your choice, continue with one of the following:

2.  [Jumpstarting a FreeMarker-based Magnolia project](../Jumpstarting-a-freemarker-based-magnolia-project/)
