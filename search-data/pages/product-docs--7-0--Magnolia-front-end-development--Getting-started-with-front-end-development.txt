# Getting started with front-end development

Magnolia supports two main approaches for building front-end applications:

-   **Headless development** using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue, with either client-side rendering or server-side rendering.

-   **FreeMarker-based development** for traditional server-side rendering using FreeMarker templates.


This guide walks you through setting up your environment and jumpstarting a project using the Magnolia CLI, whether you choose the headless or FreeMarker path.

## [](#_prerequisites_and_installation)Prerequisites and installation

Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary tools installed.

## [](#_get_node_js)Get node.js

Magnolia CLI is an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package providing a command line interface (CLI) tool to set up and facilitate light development with Magnolia. The Magnolia CLI tool runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you do not have Node.js installed, go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and download and install the latest LTS version.

To check the version of your node installation, run the following command in a shell:

node -v

## [](#_get_java)Get Java

Magnolia needs at least a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** to run. Check if there’s a version of Java already installed on your computer by opening the terminal or command prompt and typing `java -version`. If the system reports a version number, Java is installed on your computer.

> **Important:** See Certified stack to confirm that the version installed is supported.For local development, use 17.0.12-zulu. Example installation using SDKMAN:sdk install java 17.0.12-zulu

-   Windows

-   Mac

-   Linux


On Windows, you need a Java SE *Development* Kit (JDK). The Java *Runtime* Environment (JRE) is not enough because the Tomcat application server does not recognize it.

-   JRE is for users who run Java programs on their computers.

-   JDK is for developers who write Java-based applications.


[Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and install JDK. By default, JDK is installed at `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>\`.

For Mac, you need to download or update to Java `21` or higher. After reviewing and agreeing to the terms of the license agreement, download the file, then double-click it to launch the installation wizard and follow the installation instructions.

The installation directory varies from one Linux system to another. On Debian-based distributions, JREs or JDKs are usually installed in `/usr/lib/jvm/`.

## [](#_using_magnolia_cli)Using Magnolia CLI

We recommend using [Magnolia CLI v5](https://mgnl.io/cli) to create and manage your front-end projects.

The CLI is a plugin-based tool that supports both FreeMarker and headless setups. It provides simple commands to build your project and manage its structure.

To simplify setup, install and run the CLI on a per-project basis. The CLI will take care of downloading and configuring everything for you.

## [](#_jumpstarting_a_project)Jumpstarting a Project

The `jumpstart` command is used for both FreeMarker and headless setups. It downloads the necessary Magnolia instance, configuration files, and optionally a front-end application based on your selection.

### [](#_using_the_jumpstart_command)Using the jumpstart command

To begin, create a new directory and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir magnolia-project
cd magnolia-project
```

Then run:

```bash
npx @magnolia/cli@latest jumpstart
```

You’re prompted to choose a project category and template.

The jumpstart command lets you create a Magnolia project with either:

-   A headless starter project and demo content

-   FreeMarker templates and demo content


Depending on your choice, continue with one of the following:

1.  [Jumpstarting a headless Magnolia project](../Jumpstarting-a-headless-magnolia-project/)

2.  [Jumpstarting a FreeMarker-based Magnolia project](../Jumpstarting-a-freemarker-based-magnolia-project/)
