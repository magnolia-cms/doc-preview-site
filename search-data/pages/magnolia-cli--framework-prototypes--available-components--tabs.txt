# Tabs

The Tabs component organizes content into tabbed sections. Each tab can display a description that supports basic formatting and an image.

    -   `imageChooser` (optional) - A switchable field for selecting an image source:

## [](#_behavior)Behavior

-   At least one tab item is required.

-   Content rendering logic:

    -   If only description is provided - it fills the full width of the tab content area.

    -   If only image is provided - the image is centered and rendered at full width.

    -   If both image and description are present:

        -   Image is displayed on the left (50% width).

        -   Description is displayed on the right (50% width).



-   Clicking on a tab updates the content shown below.
