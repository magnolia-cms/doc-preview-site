# Link management

Configure Magnolia to standardize how URLs are generated so your pages use a consistent format and avoid duplicate URL variants.

You may prefer URLs that end with a trailing slash rather than file extensions like `.html` or `.jsp`, so that your site consistently uses a single URL style and avoids search engines treating different variants as separate pages. Also, configuring trailing slashes allows for automated redirects and canonical tags, ensuring consistent links for better ranking and link equity.
