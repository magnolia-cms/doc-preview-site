# Swift publication in the Pages app

You can use the usual publication actions from DX Core to publish. The Swift publication actions decorate the existing DX Core actions. The only differences you’ll notice are in the Status column. These are summarized in [Publication status](#_publication_status).

There are three publishing actions:

-   **Publish**: Publishes the selected node to the public instance.

-   **Publish incl. subnodes**: Publishes the selected node and its children to the public instance. This action typically runs asynchronously because it can take a while to publish lots of content.

-   **Unpublish**: Unpublishes (deactivates) the node from the public instance.


> **Note:** If a parent node isn’t published yet, you can’t publish the child node (the action is grayed out).

Apps typically display the publishing status in the workbench.

> **Important:** Magnolia strongly recommends migrating existing JCR content to Swift storage before publishing any content with Swift publication.Once content is migrated, you have the possibility to restore previous versions. However, if you create pages and publish them with Swift publication before migrating content, nodes without JCR versions don’t have hasVersion mixin properties. For nodes without JCR versions, you need to create another Swift version to bring back the restore action for that node.

## [](#_publication_status)Publication status

The page editor displays the publication status in the status bar at the bottom of the screen, and on each component that has changed.

 StatusDescription

Published

Content is published from the author instance to the public instance. Identical content exists on both instances.

In progress

Content is *in the process of being published* from the author to public instances. It changes to published when the author instance has received replies from all the public instances.

> **Important:** When publishing, if a public instance is down, REST will retry for a period before returning an error if unsuccessful. The tooltip of the Status column for this field shows the number of publications completed and the total publication requests.

Modified

Content was modified since publication. The author instance isn’t in sync with the public.

Draft

Content exists only on the author instance.

Error

An error is generated if the content can’t be published for some reason, for example, because you tried to publish a child page whose parent page was deleted on a public instance. Errors are reported back to the author instance through the message broker queues. Automatic retries aren’t performed to be more transparent about publication issues.

Marked for deletion

Content is marked for deletion but still appears in the list (grayed out). It can be restored or permanently deleted.
