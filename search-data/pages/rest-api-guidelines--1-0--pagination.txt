# REST Design – Pagination

Specifies pagination requirements for large result sets. The specific pagination rules (159, 248, 254) are documented in [\[design-principles\]](#design-principles) as they cannot be enforced via OpenAPI specification validation alone.

See [\[design-principles\]](#design-principles) for:

-   Rule 159 – Use pagination (future custom rule M003)

-   Rule 248 – Pagination response structure (future custom rule M004)

-   Rule 254 – Avoid total result count (future custom rule M005)
