# REST Design – Request and Response Rules

Defines the rules for request and response payloads, including mandatory JSON usage, top-level response objects, standard media types, and consistent error handling via Problem JSON.

## [](#107)**SHOULD** prefer compatible extensions \[107\]

Adopted

APIs should be designed with extensibility in mind. Use `x-extensible-enum` instead of a fixed `enum` when the set of values may grow over time. This allows adding new values without breaking existing clients.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #107](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#107)

## [](#110)**MUST** response as JSON object \[110\]

Adopted

Responses must be represented as JSON objects at the top level.

Top-level JSON arrays must be avoided to allow future extensibility and to enable the inclusion of additional meta information alongside the primary payload.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #110](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#110)

## [](#154)**SHOULD** use form-style query format for collection parameters \[154\]

Adopted

Collection parameters (arrays) in query strings must use the form-style format with `explode: true` (the default in OpenAPI 3).

Example:

```none
GET /items?status=active&status=pending
```

This is the most widely supported format across HTTP clients and servers.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #154](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#154)

## [](#167)**MUST** use JSON as payload data interchange format \[167\]

Adopted

JSON must be used as the primary data interchange format for request and response payloads.

APIs must support `application/json` and ensure that payloads are encoded using UTF-8.

> **Note:** This design principle is partially enforced by Zally rule 172 (MediaTypesRule).

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #167](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#167)

## [](#171)**MUST** define format for type number and integer \[171\]

Adopted

All number and integer fields in OpenAPI specifications must have an explicit `format` defined.

Valid formats: \* `int32` – 32-bit signed integer \* `int64` – 64-bit signed integer \* `float` – single precision floating point \* `double` – double precision floating point

This ensures consistent handling across different platforms and languages.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #171](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#171)

## [](#172)**SHOULD** prefer standard media type names \[172\]

Adopted

APIs should use standard media type names whenever possible, such as `application/json`.

Custom media types should only be introduced when there is a clear and well-justified need.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #172](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#172)

## [](#174)**MUST** use common field names \[174\]

Customized

APIs should use common field names for standard concepts to ensure consistency across different APIs.

Magnolia conventions:

-   `id` – resource identifier

-   `createdAt` – creation timestamp (ISO 8601)

-   `modifiedAt` – last modification timestamp (ISO 8601)

-   `createdBy` – user who created the resource

-   `modifiedBy` – user who last modified the resource


> **Note:** Magnolia uses camelCase for field names instead of Zalando’s snake_case.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #174](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#174)

## [](#176)**MUST** support Problem JSON \[176\]

Adopted

APIs must support the Problem JSON format as defined in RFC 7807 for error responses.

Error responses should include standardized fields such as:

-   `type`

-   `title`

-   `status`

-   `detail`

-   `instance`


This ensures consistent and machine-readable error handling across APIs.
