## [](#_working_together)Working together

The number of concurrent editors is displayed at the bottom of the page editor. Click the icon to see who is editing the same page.

![Tour preview with the number of users editing the page at the bottom](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2_soft-locking_collaborating-users.png)

If users leave the page or new users start editing the page, the icon showing currently active users is updated accordingly. Additionally, notification messages are displayed in certain situations:

-   When another user saves their changes.

-   If the page is moved.

-   If the page is deleted.


> **Note:** When multiple people edit the same dialog simultaneously, the last change made by any editor overrides all previous changes. For example, Jane and Eric open a dialog to update page content, making changes concurrently. Jane is the last person to save changes, so her changes overwrite those from Eric.
