# Bill of Materials (BOM) for dependencies

> A software bill of materials (software BOM) is a list of components in a piece of software. Software vendors often create products by assembling open source and commercial software components. The software BOM describes the components in a product. It is analogous to a list of ingredients on food packaging. (Wikipedia)

## [](#_overview)Overview

Magnolia uses Maven BOMs to centralize and manage dependency versions across your projects. This ensures version consistency and simplifies dependency management.

Magnolia provides two main BOMs:

-   [Third-party dependencies BOM](#_third_party_dependencies_bom): Manages versions of external libraries (Spring, Jackson, etc.)

-   [Extensions BOM](#_extensions_bom): Manages versions of libraries used by DX Core extensions


Both BOMs use Maven’s dependency import mechanism, allowing you to inherit pre-configured dependency versions without explicitly declaring them in your project.

## [](#_third_party_dependencies_bom)Third-party dependencies BOM

The third-party dependencies BOM (`magnolia-external-dependencies`) centralizes versions for common external libraries used throughout Magnolia projects.

### [](#_when_to_use)When to use

Use this BOM to:

-   Ensure compatibility with Magnolia’s tested third-party library versions

-   Avoid version conflicts between different libraries

-   Simplify upgrades by changing a single version number


### [](#_adding_to_your_project)Adding to your project

Include this snippet as the first dependency in the `dependencyManagement` section of your parent POM:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <!-- Third-party BOM -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>info.magnolia.boms</groupId>
      <artifactId>magnolia-external-dependencies</artifactId>
      <version>{magnola-latest-version}</version> (1)
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Module BOM -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>info.magnolia.dx</groupId>
      <artifactId>magnolia-dx-core-parent</artifactId>
      <version>{magnola-latest-version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The latest version is `6.4.3`. |

> **Important:** The order matters. Place the third-party BOM before the Magnolia module BOM to ensure proper version resolution.

### [](#_3rd_party_libraries_list)3rd-party libraries list

A list of licenses of third-party libraries used by Magnolia as part of the build is displayed in the **Libraries license info** tab of the About app.

On Magnolia Cloud, there is no other option to get an overview of these libraries and their licenses.

| Magnolia DX Core Version | Extensions BOM Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `6.4.x` | `6.4` | Required for extensions compatibility |
| `6.3.x` | `6.3` | First version with extensions BOM |
| `6.2.x and earlier` |  | Extensions BOM not available |

## [](#_best_practices)Best practices

### [](#_bom_ordering)BOM ordering

Always import BOMs in this order:

1.  Third-party dependencies BOM

2.  Extensions BOM (if using DX Core extensions)

3.  Magnolia module BOM (CE or DX Core parent)


This ordering ensures proper dependency resolution and prevents version conflicts.

### [](#_version_alignment)Version alignment

Keep all BOM versions aligned with your Magnolia version:

```xml
<properties>
  <magnolia.version>{magnola-latest-version}</magnolia.version> (1)
</properties>

<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>info.magnolia.boms</groupId>
      <artifactId>magnolia-external-dependencies</artifactId>
      <version>${magnola-latest-version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>info.magnolia.boms</groupId>
      <artifactId>magnolia-extensions-bom</artifactId>
      <version>${magnola-latest-version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The latest version is `6.4.3`. |

### [](#_troubleshooting)Troubleshooting

#### [](#_dependency_conflicts)Dependency conflicts

If you encounter version conflicts:

1.  Check that BOMs are imported in the correct order.

2.  Verify all BOMs use the same Magnolia version.

3.  Use `mvn dependency:tree` to identify conflicting versions.

4.  Consider excluding transitive dependencies if necessary.


#### [](#_missing_dependencies)Missing dependencies

If dependencies are not resolved:

1.  Ensure the BOM artifacts are available in your Maven repository

2.  Check network connectivity to Maven Central or your corporate repository

3.  Verify the BOM version exists (especially important for extensions BOM pre-6.3)
