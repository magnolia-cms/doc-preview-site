# Categories app

The Categories app allows you to create categories for content tagging. When applied to content, categories appear as a set of metadata that describes and classifies the content. Categories are displayed as links in the article header or as a weighted list. By clicking category links, visitors can discover related content, resulting in more page views and longer stays on the site.

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

The Categories app is configured in `/categories-app/apps/categories-app.yaml`. The app configuration can be modified using [definition decoration](../../../Developing/Definition-decoration/).

### [](#_workspace)Workspace

The Categories app operates on the `category` workspace.

### [](#_node_types)Node types

The Categories app registers a custom `mgnl:category` [node type](../../../Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) and operates on nodes of this type and on folders.

## [](#_usage)Usage

See [Categorization module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Categorization-module/).
