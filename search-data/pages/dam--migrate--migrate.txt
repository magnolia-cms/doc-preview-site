# Migrate

With the DAM module you can:

-   Store both asset *metadata* and *binaries* in JCR.

-   Store asset *metadata* in JCR and *binaries* in external storage, such as AWS S3.


Magnolia provides scripts to assist you in three migration paths:

-   [Migrate from DAM 4 JCR storage to DAM 6 *JCR* binary storage](../migrate-jcr-to-dam/) - optional.

-   [Migrate from DAM 4 JCR storage to DAM 6 *S3* or *Azure Blob* binary storage](../migrate-jcr-to-dam/) - mandatory to use S3 or Azure Blob.

-   [Migrate from Hybrid Assets incubator with an external content store to DAM 6 binary storage](../migrate-HA-to-dam/) - mandatory to use S3 or Azure Blob.
