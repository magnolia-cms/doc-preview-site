# Visitors app

Use the Visitors app to manually edit or delete consent given by website visitors.

Magnolia stores a data item in the Visitors app for every visitor who submits personal data and consents to their data being stored. A visitor can often withdraw their consent by, for example, clicking a link on webpage. Alternatively, consent can be edited manually using the Visitors app in Magnolia.

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

### [](#_workspaces)Workspaces

The Visitors app operates on the `visitors` JCR workspace.

Note that data displayed in the Visitors app may have references to data stored in other workspaces too. You can see these dependencies using the [Show dependencies](#showing-dependencies) action.

## [](#_privacy_module_writes_into_the_contacts_app)Privacy module writes into the contacts app

**Visitors app adds also contacts**

In the Magnolia DX Core Travel Demo, the `contacts` workspace is registered in the configuration of the Privacy module for demonstration purposes of dealing with personal data. This means the Visitors app interacts not only with the `visitors` workspace but also with the `contacts` workspace, which is otherwise primarily used by the [Contacts app](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Contacts-app/).
