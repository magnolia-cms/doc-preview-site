# Visitors app

Use the Visitors app to manually edit or delete consent given by website visitors.

Magnolia stores a data item in the Visitors app for every visitor who submits personal data and consents to their data being stored. A visitor can often withdraw their consent by, for example, clicking a link on webpage. Alternatively, consent can be edited manually using the Visitors app in Magnolia.

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

### [](#_workspaces)Workspaces

The Visitors app operates on the `visitors` JCR workspace.

Note that data displayed in the Visitors app may have references to data stored in other workspaces too. You can see these dependencies using the [Show dependencies](#showing-dependencies) action.

## [](#_privacy_module_writes_into_the_contacts_app)Privacy module writes into the contacts app

**Visitors app adds also contacts**

In the Magnolia DX Core Travel Demo, the `contacts` workspace is registered in the configuration of the Privacy module for demonstration purposes of dealing with personal data. This means the Visitors app interacts not only with the `visitors` workspace but also with the `contacts` workspace, which is otherwise primarily used by the [Contacts app](../Contacts-app/).

## [](#_gdpr_data_is_stored_on_public_and_must_be_synchronized_on_clusters)GDPR data is stored on public and must be synchronized on clusters

Data is stored on the public context.

> **Important:** Synchronization between public nodes may be required.

The record of consent for form-based data in the `visitors` workspace is created on the *public* Magnolia instance, never on the author instance. This is also true for referenced content, for instance in the `contacts` workspace.

You must synchronize the consent records stored if you use several public instances. The instances, or in our sample implementation at least the `visitors`, `pendingContacts` and `contacts` workspaces, must be clustered to share accounts between the different instances. Alternatively, implement observation-based synchronization to replicate visitor and contact data across instances.

### [](#_app_definition)App definition

The Visitors app is defined using YAML in the Magnolia Maven module `magnolia-privacy-ui`, which is part of the [Privacy module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Privacy-module/).

If you want to change the app definition, you can [decorate](../../../Developing/Definition-decoration/) it, create a copy in the resources workspace with the [Resource Files app](../../../Developing/Resources/#resource-files-app) or create a copy in a file-based light module using the Magnolia [resources origins loading order](../../../Developing/Resources/#origins-and-loading-order).

### [](#_personal_fields_configuration)Personal fields configuration

The personal fields section contains a list of fields for which a visitor must give consent.

| Node name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 📁 modules |     |
| 📁 magnolia-privacy-sample |     |
| 📁 config |     |
| 📁 personalFields |     |
| ⸬ name |     |
| ⸬ fieldNames |     |
| ⬩ firstName | firstName |
| ⬩ lastName | lastName |

 PropertyDescription

`<node-name>`

The name of the node that defines a personal field.

The node name is arbitrary but it must be unique.

     `fieldNames`

The node `fieldNames` keeps a list of properties to identify field names that are used for a specific purpose.

         `<field-name>`

The name of a field that is used for a specific purpose for which a user must give consent.

> **Important:** The field name must be identical to the one used in the form where the visitor provides the data.

This data is bootstrapped by the module `magnolia-privacy-sample`, which is part of the [Privacy module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Privacy-module/). The definition of the personal fields is used in the dialog to [update consent](#updating-consent).

If you want to make a form privacy-aware (and so require users to give consent for a given form field), you may have to add an additional property to the `fieldNames` node. See [Creating a GDPR compliant form](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Privacy-module/GDPR-and-forms/#creating-a-gdpr-compliant-form) and [Making an existing form GDPR compliant](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Privacy-module/GDPR-and-forms/#making-an-existing-form-gdpr-compliant).

## [](#_usage)Usage

> **Tip:** Website visitor-related data is created on the public instances. You must use the Visitors app on the public instance.

Use the Visitors app to:

-   Edit and delete existing data for a visitor.

-   View and update dependencies with data items stored in other workspaces for a visitor.


You cannot add new items manually with this app.

> **Note:** The email address of a visitor is used as the Visitor ID, which makes it easy to find a particular visitor.

### [](#_showing_dependencies)Showing dependencies

Click **Show dependencies** to show the data in other workspaces for the selected visitor.

You can click referenced content items to open the related app.

### [](#_deleting_items)Deleting items

Click **Delete item** to delete existing data for a visitor including any referenced data.

If the item contains references to other data stored for the visitor, the Visitors app shows you the related content and asks you to confirm the deletion.

### [](#_updating_consent)Updating consent

Click **Update consent** to update a visitor’s consent manually. This may be necessary in cases where, for example, consent is given over the phone.

In the Edit consent dialog you can add or remove a predefined set of fields for which a website visitor is asked to give or deny consent.

When you update a visitor’s consent manually, you must provide a source. The source can be a website (where you run your Magnolia instance), an email address or a phone number.

| Source | Example value |
| --- | --- |
| Website | [http://www.example.org/travel/contact.html?mgnlFormToken=2b1084c4-fd7c-48c5-95ac-b6def1b5a840](http://www.example.org/travel/contact.html?mgnlFormToken=2b1084c4-fd7c-48c5-95ac-b6def1b5a840) |
| Email | mailto:hans.mueller@example.com |
| Phone | ‭tel:+41-79-123-45-67 |

The source must comply with a certain format:

-   `http(s)://` for website URLs.

-   `mailto:` for email addresses.

-   `tel:` for phone numbers.


### [](#_updating_references)Updating references

If consent is updated or withdrawn for a given item, you must also update or withdraw it for any related items.

Click **Update references** to update referenced data.

The system informs you of what referenced data may be updated and asks you to confirm the action by clicking **Proceed**.

The referenced content items for a visitor are always shown, even if there is no update required.
