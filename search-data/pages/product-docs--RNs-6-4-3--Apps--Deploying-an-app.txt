# Deploying an app

This pages matters only if you define your app via JCR configuration. Since Magnolia 5.4 you can define an app with a YAML file too - see [App descriptor](../App-configuration/App-descriptor/). If you define the app via YAML - the configuration can be part of a [light module](../../Modules/Light-modules/) or in the resources folder of Magnolia Maven module - see [Module structure](../../Modules/Module-structure/).

## [](#_bootstrapping_app_configuration)Bootstrapping app configuration

To package your app for deployment:

1.  Add an `apps` folder under your module configuration.

2.  Under `apps`, add a content node and name it after your app name, for example `helloworld`.

3.  Under the app content node, create the app properties and set their values.

4.  Export the app configuration into XML and include it in your bootstrap files so that it is installed when the module is installed.


See [App descriptor](../App-configuration/App-descriptor/) for an example.

## [](#_bootstrapping_the_app_launcher_layout)Bootstrapping the App launcher layout

To make your app icon available in the App launcher:

1.  Add the app to an existing group in the [Apps launcher layout](../../Administration/App-Launcher/App-launcher-layout/) or create a new group for it.

2.  Export the app launcher configuration into XML and include it in your bootstrap files.
