# Magnolia DEV MCP

Magnolia DEV MCP is an AI-powered development toolkit for Magnolia CMS, built on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It gives AI assistants such as Claude, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot direct access to your Magnolia development workflows, from scaffolding projects to validating templates against a running instance.

The server uses a plugin architecture. You install only the plugins you need, and the AI assistant discovers their tools automatically.

| Package | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `@magnolia-ai/mcp-cli-plugin` | Project scaffolding, component and page generation, Magnolia CLI command execution. |
| `@magnolia-ai/mcp-magnolia-api-plugin` | Talks to a running Magnolia instance via REST: CRUD on JCR nodes, content queries, definition validation, template rendering. |
| `@magnolia-ai/mcp-figma-plugin` | Extracts component designs from Figma for AI-driven code generation. |
| `@magnolia-ai/mcp-lovable-plugin` | Extracts component designs from Lovable for AI-driven code generation. |
| `@magnolia-ai/mcp-log-plugin` | Real-time log monitoring, error search, and correlation with tool executions. |
