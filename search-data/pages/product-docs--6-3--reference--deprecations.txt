-   Announced in: [Magnolia 6.3.0 Release notes](../../Releases/Release-notes-for-Magnolia-CMS-6.3/#_local_image_recognition_module_discontinued)


We have discontinued the option to use a local, pre-trained neural network for the [Image Recognition module](../../../../image-recognition/). This feature was experimental and relied on outdated and unmaintained libraries. Amazon Rekognition is now the reference implementation for the Image Recognition module.
