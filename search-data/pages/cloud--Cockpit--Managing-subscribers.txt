The package overview page displays a list of stakeholders and their contact details in the **Users** (previously *People*) section. Here, you find Owners, Developers, Subscribers, and Magnolia Support contacts. Owners and Developers have Cockpit access and all of the privileges that come along with this. However, Subscribers do not have Cockpit access but simply receive notifications (such as RDS and maintenance emails) in relation to the Cockpit.

Currently, there is a limit of 40 subscribers.

To manage subscribers:

1.  Navigate to **Users > Subscriber** and select Manage subscribers.

2.  Select **\+ Add Subscriber** to add a subscriber to the list.

3.  To edit a subscriber’s name or email, select the **Edit Icon** or to remove a subscriber.

4.  To remove a subscriber, select the **Trash Icon**.
