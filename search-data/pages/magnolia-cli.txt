## [](#_versions)Versions

### [](#_supported)Supported

[**Magnolia CLI v5**](getting-started/), a plugin-based CLI designed for developers seeking modularity and the ability to extend functionalities through custom CLI commands.

### [](#_end_of_life)End-of-life

[**Magnolia CLI v4**](#4.x@magnolia-cli:ROOT:magnolia-cli.adoc), a command-based CLI, reached end-of-life (EOL) on April 16, 2025. It’s no longer maintained and will not receive any updates, including security fixes. For continued support, improvements, and compatibility with current Magnolia versions, use CLI version 5.

Version 4 includes the legacy *Magnolia 5 UI* prototypes, which are marked with the `-m5` suffix.

> **Note:** CLI versions 2 and 3, while still available for installation through NPM, are no longer supported.
