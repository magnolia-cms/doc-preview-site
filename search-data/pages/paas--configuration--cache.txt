# Cache

You can see cache information directly in your Cockpit in the [Content delivery](../../cockpit/sections/content-delivery/) section. You can configure what items are cached.

To configure what to cache, you need to update the configuration in your Magnolia instance and not directly via the CDN.

> **Tip:** Typically, you would find this at:/modules/cache/config/contentCaching/defaultPageCache/browserCachePolicy/policies/resources

Default cached items

By default, CSS, JavaScript, and images are cached. Pages are not cached by default. However, you can configure your policy to cache Pages.

See [Server cache policy](#_server_cache_policy) for help with that.
