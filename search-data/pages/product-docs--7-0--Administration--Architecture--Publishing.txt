# Publishing overview

Publishing handles how content gets published from an author instance to a public instances. DX Core publishing is the default bundled option.

## [](#_swift_publication)Swift publication

DX Core [publishing performance](Publishing-performance/) can be optimized in several ways to handle increased publishing demands. However, we recommend using the external [Swift publication](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Swift-publication/) in production environments if you need to scale publication in terms of public instances and reduce the load on your author instance.
