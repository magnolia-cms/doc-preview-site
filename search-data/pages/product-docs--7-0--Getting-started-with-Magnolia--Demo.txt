## [](#_about_the_website)About the website

Magnolia Travel is the website of a fictional travel agency that sells package tours. This business scenario helps showcase the benefits of Magnolia.

The demo illustrates important Magnolia features such as [publishing](../../Administration/Architecture/Publishing/), [user roles](#_user_roles), multilanguage [content](#_multilanguage_website) and [authoring](#_multilanguage_authoring), [multiple sites](#_multisite) that [reuse](#_content_reuse) the same content, [personalization](#_personalization), [marketing tags](#_marketing_tags) and more - all in a modern, attractive, responsive design. Site content is managed in both a traditional page hierarchy and as a content pool in the Tours and Tour categories content apps.

As you browse the site, imagine what your products or services could look like in a site like this. Tours could be replaced with whatever products, information or departments are important in your organization.

## [](#_website_overview)Website overview

The homepage has a typical structure with a top navigation and footer that is shared across all pages. The navigation contains two dropdowns.

1.  **Tours** is a list of tour categories, which we call tour types, like Beach, Cultural or Family tours.

2.  **Destinations** is a list of tour destinations like North America and Europe.


### [](#_website_pages)Website pages

The Website pages demonstrate key features of Magnolia:

-   The home page contains a big carousel featuring hand-picked tours. Under the carousel, three icons link to some of the tour types that are available in the dropdown menu.

-   The **About** page is an example of a conventional or simple page. It is the parent of a typical website tree of pages. The meta links in the footer also link to simple pages.

-   The overview pages for each tour type and destination category have the same format. Each has an image, title and description, followed by a block of featured tours in the category, and then a block of all tours in the category. Go to **Beach** and **Cultural** in the **Tours** menu and **Europe** in the **Destinations** menus to see examples. Note the tour type icons below the title in the teasers. Tours can belong to multiple tour type categories and will display in all overview pages.
    ![Overview Tours page](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-demo-beachTours.png)

-   The format of the detail page of each tour is also the same. Click **View Tour** in any teaser to access the detail page. Tour type icons display in the title and lead to type overview pages. Below the tour details at the bottom of the page, there are card blocks of other tours within in the categories that a visitor might be interested in.
    ![Greece](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-demo-viewTourSpectacular.png)

-   The **Members** page allows users of a public Magnolia site to register and access restricted content. User registration is powered by Magnolia’s [Public User Registration module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Public-User-Registration-module/).

-   The **Contact** page includes a sample online form powered by Magnolia’s [Form module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Form-module/).

-   Search results display on a dedicated page. Enter a term in the box to see the results.


### [](#_content_structure)Content Structure

To view the content structure and source, log in to Admincentral with username and password `superuser`.

Open the **Pages app** and expand the `travel` and `about` nodes.

-   The pages under `about` are a simple hierarchy. Content for these pages is added in the page editor. If you scroll further down, you’ll find also the `meta` page. The parent `meta` page is not displayed in navigation because the `Don’t show this page in any site navigation` option is enabled in the Page properties dialog.

-   The `travel` subpages, `tour-type`, `destination` and `tour` display the content for all tours. This content is added and stored in apps. Based on the URL, the content page retrieves the appropriate content item from the app and displays it.


![Pages app with subpages](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-30-demo-pagesApp.png)

Open the **Tour Categories** app to see the tour types and destinations. These are the tour type and destination categories that link the tours together.

![Tour types folder structure](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-30-demo-tourCategories.png)

Open the **Tours** content app to see the tours. This is where the bulk of the site content resides. In a way, the site *builds itself* - the navigation and tour pages are dynamically generated based on the content added in this app.

## [](#_magnolia_features)Magnolia Features

Some of the key Magnolia features are showcased in the Travel Demo.

### [](#_user_roles)User roles

Magnolia has a powerful and flexible [security](../../Administration/Security/) mechanism based on [roles](../../Administration/IAM/Roles-and-access-control-lists/), [groups](../../Administration/IAM/Groups/) and [users](../../Administration/IAM/Users/). You can specify which [apps](../../Administration/IAM/App-permissions/) and [actions](../../Administration/IAM/App-permissions/), and even which content within an app, a user can access. You can also limit who can request and publish workflows.

Open the [Security app](../../Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/) to explore. Log out as `superuser` and log in as `eric` (password `eric`). Notice that fewer apps are available, for example, the Security app is no longer available.

The Travel Demo includes three users to illustrate typical roles: (Password is always the same as the user name.)

-   `eric`: An editor who can edit all content. In the Pages app in CE he cannot access the **Publish** action. He can submit items for publication with the **Publish** action, but he cannot actually publish content.

-   `peter`: A publisher who can also edit all content. In the Pages app in CE he can access the **Publish** action. He can also view items submitted for publication in the Tasks app, and approve (publish) or reject them.

-   `tina`: A tour editor who cannot access content in the Pages app.


### [](#_publication_and_workflow)Publication and Workflow

Magnolia’s publication takes advantage of the Workflow system. While any workflow can be implemented, in the Travel Demo you can try the standard `four-eye` publishing workflow which comes with Magnolia out-of-the-box. Eric the editor can edit content, and submit it for approval. Peter the publisher receives notifications in the Tasks app, and can review the changes made, and finally publish the changes to the public instances - or reject them.

### [](#_multilanguage_website)Multilanguage website

The Travel Demo supports two [content languages](../../Administration/Language/Types-of-translatable-text/), English and German.

To see this in action, edit the `contact` page.

-   Use the language selector in the bottom bar to change from English to German. The content of the page is now displayed in German.
    ![Contact page in German](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-30-demo-contactPageDE.png)

-   Click on **Main** bar and then on the edit icon in the **Jumbotron** bar. Use the language selector in the Text and Image dialog to view and edit the content in either language.
    ![Text and image dialog](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-30-demo-jumbotronEdit.png)


### [](#_multilanguage_authoring)Multilanguage authoring

Admincentral can also be translated into multiple languages.

### [](#_content_reuse)Content reuse

The Travel Demo is a good example of efficient content reuse and demonstrates how this can easily be accomplished using content apps to store tours.

A tour is stored in one location, but the information is used throughout the site from the homepage to the tour pages.

As a best practice, content should be added and maintained in *one location* and used throughout the website, or in external apps, widgets or feeds. It should never be necessary to add the same content multiple times,

Compare the information in the Tours app to the content on the site pages to see how it is reused.

### [](#_content_delivery_methods_rest_and_graphql)Content delivery methods: REST and GraphQL

The Tour Finder page of the demo also showcases two modern ways of content delivery, [REST](../../../../rest/api/delivery-endpoint/) and [GraphQL](../../Developing/API/GraphQL-API/).

In a REST implementation, searching a tour on the page sends a request to a configured REST delivery endpoint accessible through `https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/.rest/delivery/tours/v1/` whereas GraphQL-mediated tour searches are directed to a GraphQL endpoint available at `https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/.graphql`.

#### [](#_content_type_property_suffixes)Content type property suffixes

When you define a content type property, you should avoid using a 2-letter suffix. This is because Magnolia reads the suffix as a language such as `property_en` or `property_de`.

> **Caution:** If you add a 2-letter suffix, the property is not delivered when using the Delivery API.

Example

```yaml
datasource:
  $type: jcrContentTypeDatasource
  workspace: tourguides
  namespaces:
    mt: https://www.magnolia-travel.com/jcr/1.0/mt
  autoCreate: true

model:
  nodeType: mt:tourGuide
  properties:
    - name: description (1)
      type: String
      i18n: true
...
    - name: description_ins (2)
      type: String
      i18n: true
...
    - name: description_in (3)
      type: String
      i18n: true
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | A correct property name with no suffix. |
| **2** | A correct property name with an acceptable suffix. |
| **3** | An incorrect property name with the 2-letter suffix. |

#### [](#_example_search_a_family_tour_in_europe)Example search: A family tour in Europe

Let’s suppose you are interested in a family-type tour whose destination is in Europe. In the search form, you tick the following filter options:

![REST and GraphQL options selection](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-12-Demo-tourFinderRestGrapghQL-checkboxes.png)

Underneath, the values associated with such a filter configuration are in UUID form and are used as request parameters.

```html
<label class="ng-binding">
  <input type="checkbox" value="6cc50e28-fb0e-4e49-b3b6-728690a2e861"
     ng-model="useDestinations[destination.id]" ... >Europe
</label>
...

<label class="ng-binding">
  <input type="checkbox" value="17da160b-da66-4e09-9e31-5fd040880f4a"
     ng-model="useTourTypes[tourType.id]" ... >Family
</label>
```

-   Query string parameters for a REST request:

    destination=6cc50e28-fb0e-4e49-b3b6-728690a2e861&tourTypes=17da160b-da66-4e09-9e31-5fd040880f4a&lang=en

-   A request payload for a GraphQL request:

    {"query":"query FilterTours($filter: String!) {\\n    tours(filter: $filter, limit: 50) {\\n        name\\n        image {\\n            name\\n            renditions(renditionNames:\[\\"960x720\\"\]) {\\n                link\\n                renditionName\\n            }\\n        }\\n        tourTypes {\\n            displayName\\n            icon {\\n                link\\n            }\\n        }\\n        destination {\\n            displayName\\n        }\\n        duration\\n        \_metadata {\\n          path\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n","variables":{"filter":"@tourTypes='17da160b-da66-4e09-9e31-5fd040880f4a' AND @destination='6cc50e28-fb0e-4e49-b3b6-728690a2e861'"}}


The responses from the server for both of the delivery methods are then instantly rendered on the Tour Finder page as three tours matching the filter selection:

![REST and GraphQL options in the Tour Finder - example where response matches a filter setting](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-12-Demo-tourFinderRestGrapghQLResponses.png)

### [](#_multisite)Multisite

The Travel Demo has a simple additional site, SportStation, which demonstrates sharing of web resources, components, and tour content across sites.

A Magnolia instance can host multiple sites that share configuration, resources and content. This is useful in a variety of situations - from campaigns and landing pages to managing sites for all departments, branches or subsidiaries of your organization. This feature is often used to simplify and consolidate management of the many websites company accumulates over time.

To view the SportStation site, edit the `sportstation` page in the Pages app and click **Preview page** in the editor.

-   SportStation offers only Active tours and uses the same content as Travel.

-   Site styling is similar to Travel because the same web resources are used.

-   The home page features a carousel of hand-picked active tours and then a tour list of all tours in the Active category, displayed in teaser blocks.

-   The tour detail pages are very similar to those in Travel but do not include icons linking to tour types or destinations, nor are their related tours at the bottom of the page.


![Sportstation preview page](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-30-demo-sportstationPreview.png)

### [](#_personalization)Personalization

Magnolia sites can be personalized for individual visitors based on [visitor traits](../../use-cases/Personalization/) such as cookies, location, date, information in a user profile, or information shared via social networks.

#### [](#_page_personalization)Page personalization

The Travel Demo illustrates page personalization with three variants of the contact page. Different contact information displays in the second **Text and image** component depending on the location trait of the visitor.

To view the personalized pages:

-   In the Pages app expand the `contact` and `Variants` nodes. There is one variant for each geographic region.

-   Select the `contact` page and click **Preview as visitor** in the action bar.

-   In the overlay select different sample users to view the page variants.


![Preview as a visitor](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-2-30-demo-sportstationPreview.png)

#### [](#_component_personalization)Component personalization

The Travel Demo illustrates component personalization on the home page using the Tour type cookie.

To view the personalized components:

-   In the Pages app open the `travel` page in the editor.

-   Click the **Preview in tab** button in the bottom right corner to view the page in the browser.

-   Click **Active** in the **Which tour type are you?** component.

-   View any tour page and click the logo to navigate back to the home page.

-   The question is hidden and the Featured tours (by tour type) component displays active tours below the carousel.


### [](#_marketing_tags)Marketing tags

The [Marketing Tags app](../../Apps/List-of-apps/Marketing-Tags-app/) integrates with marketing services like Clicky and Google Analytics. Marketing teams can add snippets of HTML or JavaScript to all or any set of pages without code changes or developer assistance.

To see this in action:

-   Open the Marketing Tags app.

-   Edit any tag to view the configuration options.

-   Click **Show provider dashboard** to view the provider dashboard (as configured in the tag). You can also view the dashboard in your browser.

-   View the page source of any page on the public instance to confirm that the tag is added to the HTML.
