# Showing pop-ups

## [](#_pop_up)Pop-up

Pop-ups are non-intrusive messages that inform the user whether an action was completed or aborted successfully. Typically they confirm something. Pop-ups look like Post-IT notes. They go away automatically and don’t require user action. Use pop-ups to confirm what the user did and provide them with confidence and assurance.

To show pop-ups, use the standard Vaadin [Notification](https://vaadin.com/api/framework/8/com/vaadin/ui/Notification.html).

Usage examples:

```java
// Send an INFO notification to the current user.
void openInfoNotification(String message) {
    Notification notification = Notification.show(message, Notification.Type.HUMANIZED_MESSAGE);
    notification.setDelayMsec(3600);
}

// Send an ERROR notification to the current user.
void openErrorNotification(String message) {
    Notification.show(message, Notification.Type.ERROR_MESSAGE);
}
```
