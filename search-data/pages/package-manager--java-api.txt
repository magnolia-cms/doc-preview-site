# Package Manager Java API

Package Manager is designed as a DX Core extension module rather than a framework module, which means it provides functionality as is without exposing Java extension points for customization. Unlike Framework modules that are designed for extensibility and provide well-defined Java APIs for developers to extend and customize functionality, Package Manager focuses on delivering a complete, self-contained package management solution.

A Java API typically consists of public classes, interfaces, and methods that external code can use to interact with or extend a module’s functionality programmatically. This differs from an [HTTP API](../../package-manager-api/), which provides web-based endpoints accessible over HTTP. While Package Manager provides a comprehensive HTTP API for web-based interactions, it also exposes classes in the module configuration that can be overridden, though not for customization purposes. The module is intended to be used as a complete solution rather than as a building block for custom implementations.
