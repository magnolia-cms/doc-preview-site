# Magnolia 6.3.0 known issues

Refer to the [Known issues section of the Release notes for Magnolia CMS 6.3](../##_known_issues) for information about issues that existed upon the release of 6.3.0 and are being addressed in the next 6.3 maintenance releases.

The issues on this page were discovered after the release of subsequent 6.3.x versions.

## [](#_variants_unintentionally_valued)Variants unintentionally valued

Switching between [variants](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Personalization-module/My-first-personalized-campaign/) during editing replaces the target variant being edited with the current value, even if the changes are not saved. This behavior can result in unintended updates to the target variant.

If you use variants, we recommend waiting until the release of Magnolia 6.3.2.

A fix for this issue is delivered with [MGNLUI-9095](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9095).

## [](#_h2_database_persistence_or_corruption_problems)H2 database: Persistence or corruption problems

If you’re using the H2 database, you may experience occasional persistence or corruption problems. To follow the latest development of this issue, please see [MAGNOLIA-9522](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9522).

> **Note:** We don’t recommend using H2 for production environments. For a list of production-supported databases, see Certified stack: Databases.WorkaroundsIf you use H2 for local development only, as a workaround you can downgrade to the previous version of the database.⚠️ Downgrading in this case means potentially exposing your setup to a known vulnerability in the H2 database (see mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2). ⚠️A second workaround is to switch to and use the Derby DB instead. In this case, be aware that such a move might create the Too many open files issue, which can occur on some UNIX-based systems.For more details and a solution, see Too many open files.

## [](#_performance_issues_with_the_assets_app)Performance issues with the Assets app

Some customers have reported performance problems with the Assets app after upgrading to version 6.3.2, particularly when working with large datasets. The issue arises when the system generates thumbnails for .png images, which can result in higher memory usage and potential performance degradation.

This issue affects all 6.3.x versions and is addressed in 6.3.4 with [MGNLUI-9115](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9115).

> **Important:** There is no workaround available. If you manage a large number of .png assets, we recommend postponing upgrades until the fix is available.
