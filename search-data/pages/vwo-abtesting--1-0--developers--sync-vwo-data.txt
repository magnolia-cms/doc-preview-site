# Sync VWO data

VWO campaign data is **not stored** in Magnolia. Instead, links are checked via VWO’s REST API when:

-   You start the VWO app in Magnolia.

-   Your configured background job runs asynchronously.


This ensures that there are no performance issues with the Pages App.

## [](#_configure_a_scheduled_job)Configure a scheduled job

You can configure a scheduled job using our [Scheduler module](../../../../product-docs/7.0/Modules/List-of-modules/Scheduler-module/) so that data is synced regularly. You should create a [command](../../../../product-docs/7.0/Developing/Commands/). In this example, the command is called `linkVwoCampaigns`.

> **Note:** VWO campaigns may not appear immediately in Magnolia due to the asynchronous approach here.

1.  Create a scheduler job at `/modules/scheduler/config/jobs/linkVwoCampaigns`.

    | Node name | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | 📁 scheduler |     |
    | 📁 config |     |
    | 📁 jobs |     |
    | ⸬ linkVwoCampaigns |     |
    | ⬩ catalog | abTestingVwo |
    | ⬩ command | linkVwoCampaigns |
    | ⬩ [cron](#cron) | `00 * * * *` |
    | ⬩ description | Link VWO AB campaigns to Magnolia pages |
    | ⬩ enabled | true |


### [](#_descriptions)Descriptions

-   `cron`: Runs every full hour (`00 * * * *`)


## [](#_manually_sync_campaigns)Manually sync campaigns

You can use the [Groovy app](../../../../product-docs/7.0/Apps/List-of-apps/Groovy-app/) to manually synchronize your test campaigns with VWO.

1.  Go to the Groovy App in Admincentral.

2.  Click **Add script**.

3.  Add the following Groovy script to run your `linkVwoCampaigns` command.

    ```groovy
    // trigger VWO linking command

    println "Executing VWO campaign sync..."

    cm = info.magnolia.commands.CommandsManager.getInstance()
    command = cm.getCommand('abTestingVwo', 'linkVwoCampaigns')
    command.execute(ctx)

    println "Finished linking VWO campaign."
    ```

4.  Click **Is a script?** if not already clicked.

    -    Is a script?


5.  Click **Run**.

6.  Don’t forget to save your changes.
