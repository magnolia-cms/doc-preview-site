# MIME type mapping

This page explains how MIME types (media types, content types) are mapped to file extensions in Magnolia.

| Node name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 📁 server |  |
| 📁 MIMEMapping |  |
| ⸬ html |  |
| ⬩ mime-type | text/html |
| ⸬ foobar |  |
| ⬩ mime-type | application/x-javascript |
| ⬩ extension | js |

## [](#_contenttypefilter)ContentTypeFilter

info.magnolia.cms.filters.ContentTypeFilter is a filter in the [Magnolia filter chain](../Architecture/Request-processing-and-filters/Filters/#_content_type).

ContentTypeFilter does not set the response content type, instead it’s the responsibility of renderers/servlets to set correct content type (for instance, info.magnolia.rendering.renderer.FreemarkerRenderer sets the content type). However, ContentTypeFilter sets some parameters onto info.magnolia.cms.core.AggregationState and takes care of [restricting responses to configured MIME types](#_restricting_responses_to_configured_mime_types) and [matching requests to content types](#_matching_requests_to_content_types).

### [](#_restricting_responses_to_configured_mime_types)Restricting responses to configured MIME types

By default, Magnolia tries to respond to every request, even if the MIME type is not configured. To restrict responses to configured MIME types only, add a `registeredExtensionsOnly` property to the `contentType` filter configuration:

![Mime filter](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/ADVT-mime-filter.png)

When `registeredExtensionsOnly` is `true` Magnolia will respond with [response code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) 400 to requests with extensions that are not registered in MIMEMapping.

If the request has no extension, Magnolia assumes it is `html`.

### [](#_matching_requests_to_content_types)Matching requests to content types

You can restrict responses to match content types with the `validateContentType` property.

**Example**: If you request `https://demopublic.magnolia-cms.com/travel.c`, the HTML source is returned because of the `text/plain` [MIME mapping](#_configuration) in `/server/MIMEMapping/c`

To force content type matching, add the `validateContentType` property in `server/filters/contentType` and set the value to `true`.

![Mime match](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/ADVT-mime-match.png)

When the `validateContentType` property is set to `true`, Magnolia will respond with [response code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) 400 if the requested extension does not match the content type. This property essentially disables all unknown extensions.
