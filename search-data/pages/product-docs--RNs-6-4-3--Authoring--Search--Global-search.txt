# Global Search

Global Search is your go-to tool for searching across all content in Magnolia. Located at the core of the Magnolia UI, it offers powerful full-text search capabilities, enhanced in Magnolia 6.4 with faster performance and better result organization. It’s designed to handle large datasets efficiently, delivering relevant results quickly and intuitively.

## [](#_key_features)Key features

-   Full-text search across all content: Search across all Magnolia apps, including pages, assets, tags, personas, and more, using a single search field.

-   Visual distinction: Global Search stands out with a clear overlay, making it easy to differentiate from in-app searches.

-   Improved result presentation: Results display key details like **App**, **Name**, **Status**, and **Last Updated**, with:

    -   A clear path for each item to aid navigation.


-   Click-to-Act

    -   Click-to-View - in the current tab

        Clicking a search result in the **Name** column navigates to it in the Browser subapp of its respective app - in the current tab.

    -   Click-to-View - in a new tab

        Clicking a search result at the "open-in-tab" icon on the right side opens the result in the Browser subapp of its respective app, but in a new browser tab.

-   **Parallel loading of results**: Results load in parallel from Magnolia’s JCR and external sources, ensuring fast responses even for complex queries.

-   ***Go back where I left***: Return to previous search results without starting over.


## [](#_filtering)Filtering

Filters let you refine your search results to focus on specific content types or properties. The total number of results is shown at the bottom of the page, helping you gauge the effectiveness of your search and decide if further filtering is needed.

### [](#_available_filters)Available filters

-   **App**: Restrict results to specific content apps (for example, **Pages**, **Assets**, or **Tours**).

-   **Author**: Filter by the content creator, based on the `mgnl:createdBy` property.

-   **Status**: Narrow results by publication status, such as *Modified*, *Draft*, *Marked for deletion*, or *Published*.


### [](#_filter_behavior)Filter behavior

-   Selected filters move to the top of the dropdown list, highlighted for easy reuse (for example, *Modified* appears in green with a checkmark).

-   To indicate a potential selection, an option row goes gray and shows a checkbox on hover.

-   When no filter is selected, the first option is highlighted by default.


#### [](#_items_with_no_publication_status)Items with no publication status

Some content sources, such as E-commerce, provide items that don’t have a publication status property.

The search interface handles these items differently depending on whether you are filtering or sorting by *status*.

-   Filtering by status

    If you apply a filter for a specific status (for example, `Published`), the search results only include items that have a status property matching the filter.

    Items without a status property, such as E-commerce content, are excluded from the search results.

-   Sorting by status

    In contrast to filtering, when you sort the results by publication status, items without a status property remain visible in the search results.

    These items are typically grouped together with other items that don’t have a status in the sorted list.


## [](#_sorting_and_ranking)Sorting and ranking

-   Advanced sorting options are available directly in the Global Search UI, letting you reorder results based on additional criteria.

-   On DX Core, results are ordered by relevance (ranked `0` to `1`, where `1` is highest) by default, using the search `score` property.

-   Results prioritize:

    1.  **Last used content**: Recently accessed items rank higher.

    2.  **Most used content**: Frequently interacted items are prioritized next.

    3.  **User group recommendations**: If no personal history exists, results are based on interactions from your user group (for example, editors).



## [](#_configuration)Configuration

> **Note:** Magnolia 6.4’s search is optimized for most use cases, so you typically won’t need to modify the default search settings.

-   Magnolia 6.4

-   Magnolia 6.3


In Magnolia 6.4, the default configuration is located in `/periscope-core/config.yaml`.
