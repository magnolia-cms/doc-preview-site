# Reports

> **Note:** The Reports feature is temporarily unavailable due to maintenance to improve the feature. The feature may still be visible on the Cockpit for some users, but it is currently not functioning as expected. Please bear with us while we work hard to improve DX Cloud for you.

The DX Cloud **Reports** section contains important information about your deployment’s SLAs.

> **Note:** The thresholds defined for SLAs may vary from customer to customer.

Select your desired cluster from the dropdown menu at the top of the Cockpit.

The **Reports** section contains a **Subscription Overview** tab that contains the following reports:

-   [Uptime](#_uptime)

-   [Traffic](#_traffic)

-   [Round trip](#_round_trip)

-   [CPU](#_cpu)

-   [Memory](#_memory)

-   [Storage](#_storage)

-   [Backup](#_backup)

-   [Domain](#_domain)

## [](#_uptime)Uptime

Uptime is the measurement of your DX Cloud website’s availability to your end users. This is calculated by `(total availability of the site * 100)/time = uptime`. Currently, you can view the uptime for your CDN, Ingresses, and Magnolia itself.

-   CDN availability

-   Ingress availability

-   Magnolia availability


At the **CDN level**, the percentage of HTTP requests failed with a `502 (Bad Gateway)` or `503 (Service Unavailable)` compared to the total number of requests.

At the **Ingress level**, the percentage of HTTP requests failed with a `502 (Bad Gateway)` or `503 (Service Unavailable)` compared to the total number of requests.

![ingress uptime](../../_images/reports/ingress-uptime.jpg)

At the **Magnolia level**, the percentage of HTTP requests failed with a `502 (Bad Gateway)` or `503 (Service Unavailable)` compared to the total number of requests.
