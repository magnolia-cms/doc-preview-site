# Logging in

On the Magnolia authoring login page, `[http://<YourAuthoringServer>/magnoliaAuthor/.magnolia](http://<YourAuthoringServer>/magnoliaAuthor/.magnolia)`, enter your username and password provided by your administrator.

## [](#_app_launcher)App Launcher

When you log into Magnolia, the App Launcher is the first thing you see. Depending on the roles configured for you by your administrator, it contains different sections and apps.

Administrators can change the App launcher layout to better suit your needs. This can involve changing the grouping arrangement, adding customized groups, and so on.

For more information about navigating the launcher, setting your preferences and favorites, see [D](../App-Launcher/).

## [](#_demo_site)Demo site

With Magnolia you typically get an example Travel Demo site. It showcases all the essential features. The demo is also available online at [demoauthor.magnolia-cms.com](https://demoauthor.magnolia-cms.com) and you can log in as Eric the editor (username `eric`, password `eric`), for example.

> **Note:** The demo resets every 30 minutes.

For more information about the demo site, see the [Demo section of the documentation](../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Demo/).
