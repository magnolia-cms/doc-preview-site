# HTTP session persistence

As Magnolia currently does not provide serialization of classes for HTTP clustering, persistence of HTTP sessions is disabled by default in the configuration of the Tomcat container bundled together with Magnolia.

Disabling session persistence removes the `java.io.NotSerializableException` warning from the logs. To disable the persistence in Tomcat bundled together with a previous version of Magnolia, follow the instructions available at the [`apache.org`](http://apache.org) website.

> **Note:** Session persistence settings in WebSphere:Go to Application Servers > ServerName > Session Management > Distributed environment settings.In the Distributed session properties tab, choose None.
