# Analytics app

The Analytics app provides a user-friendly interface for you to create dashboards and add widgets showing the analytics data and metrics you want to view.

Your administrator must configure the connection to your third-party analytics data supplier.

## [](#_working_with_dashboards)Working with dashboards

In the Analytics app, you can add new dashboards or edit existing dashboards to display the metrics you need.

Magnolia provides a demo dashboard to give you an example of what you can display. The demo dashboard displays four sample *widgets* (charts) drawing analytics data from different data suppliers.

![Demo dashboard](../../../../_images/analytics/analytics-demo-dashboard.png)

> **Note:** The sample charts in the demo dashboard have been enhanced using light development. For example, not all chart types or customization in terms of chart colors or labeling are available using the Analytics app UI alone.

Select the dashboard you want to view in the dashboard dropdown in the top-left corner.

The dashboard toolbar is located in the top-right corner. From there, click the icons to:

-   ![Edit icon](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-icon-edit.gif) **Rename** or **Edit** the dashboard layout

-   ![Delete icon](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-icon-delete.gif) **Delete** the dashboard

-   ![Add icon](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-icon-add.gif) **Add** a new dashboard

-   ![Refresh icon](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-icon-refresh.gif) **Refresh** the display

-   ![Filter icon](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-icon-filter.gif) **Open** the filter bar


Once you have added a new dashboard, you add widgets to display your analytics data.

> **Tip:** If no dashboards are available, a blank canvas is displayed. In this case, click  to add a new dashboard and start creating widgets.

### [](#_dashboard_name_and_layouts)Dashboard name and layouts

Click the ![Pencil icon](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-icon-edit.gif) icon to:

-   Rename your dashboard.

-   Choose different dashboard layouts to display your widgets.


![Edit dashboard dialog](../../../../_images/analytics/analytics-edit-dashboard.png)

The default layout is a two-column display. Rows are added as necessary to the dashboard to accommodate the widgets you create.

For example, if you have four widgets, and a three-column display, the last widget spans the entire second row; a fifth and sixth widget would be added to the same second row whereas a seventh would start a new row.

![Three column dashboard layout](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-dash-layout-3c.png)

> **Tip:** You can drag and drop widgets around the dashboard. When you mouse over a chart, the drag and drop handle icon appears:

### [](#_filtering_data_displayed_in_charts)Filtering data displayed in charts

Developers can define filters to drill down into the data displayed in the widgets you configure.

When set, each filter is applied to all the charts in the dashboard simultaneously. For example, if you set a filter to display a given time range, all the charts display data for that time range if applicable.

![Dashboard filters](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-dashboard-filters.png)

> **Note:** Filters are cleared when you navigate away from the dashboard.

| City (Dimension) | Visits (Metric) | Actions (Metric) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brisbane | 54 | 87 |
| Berlin | 39 | 109 |
| Surabaya | 33 | 54 |

## [](#_adding_widgets)Adding widgets

To add a widget:

1.  Click the **Add widget** button in the top left-hand corner. A dialog opens:

    ![Add widget](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-add-widget.png)

2.  Choose the data supplier for the analytics data you want to display.

3.  Enter a name for your widget. Special characters aren’t allowed.

    > **Tip:** Make sure you use a meaningful and descriptive name for your chart that explains the data shown. For example "Number of sessions by date".

4.  Select a commonly used metric.

    Note that Magnolia provides [Commonly used metrics](#_commonly_used_metrics) for out-of-the-box data suppliers.


### [](#_adding_advanced_widgets)Adding advanced widgets

To add an advanced widget:

1.  Click the **Add widget** button in the top left-hand corner.

    A dialog opens:

    ![Add widget](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-add-widget.png)

2.  Click **Add more metrics**.

    The dialog expands to show additional chart type and data selection fields:

    ![Add more metrics](../../../../_images/analytics/6-2-analytics-widget-custom.png)

3.  Choose the data supplier for the analytics data you want to display.

4.  Enter a name for your widget. Special characters aren’t allowed.

    > **Tip:** Make sure you use a meaningful and descriptive name for your chart that explains the data shown. For example "Number of sessions by date".

5.  Select the chart type you want to display. The chart types available by default are:

    1.  Bar

    2.  Metric number

    3.  Pie

    4.  Timeline


6.  Select the data for your chart. A preview is displayed at the bottom of the dialog.

7.  Use the > button to view the JSON data for the value you selected.

8.  Click **Add series** to add more data combinations to your widget as required.

9.  Repeat the previous step to add more series if required.

    Note that any additional series can also be deleted from the widget.


#### [](#_incompatible_dimension_metric_combinations)Incompatible dimension-metric combinations

Some metrics and dimensions can’t be queried together because there isn’t a proper data relation between them.

When you select an incompatible dimension-metric combination you may get an error message in Magnolia, such as "Selected dimensions and metrics cannot be queried together".

In this situation, you have two options:

-   Enter the combination and see if the error message appears. If it does, select a different combination.

-   Use the third-party tool documentation to check which dimensions and metrics can be used together. We provide a list of useful links for each out-of-the-box extension in the **Further reading** section below.


| Metric | ID |
| --- | --- |
| Visits | metrics/visits |
| Unique Visitors | metrics/visitors |
| Page Views | metrics/pageviews |
| Time Spent per Visit | metrics/timespentvisit |
| Bounce Rate | metrics/bouncerate |
