# Publishing

Publishing means transferring content from a Magnolia author instance to public instances so that visitors to your website can access the content.

> **Note:** Large flat content repositories can negatively impact overall performance, particularly search. For this reason, you must organize pages into a folder hierarchy to ensure optimal performance. Also, features that constantly create content (such as messages, tasks, and versions) should be checked regularly to clean up old content.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Published | Content is published from the author instance to the public instance. Identical content exists on both instances. |
| Modified | Content was modified since publication. The author instance isn’t in sync with the public. |
| Draft | Content exists only on the author instance. |
| Marked for deletion | Content is marked for deletion but still appears in the list (grayed out). It can be restored or permanently deleted. |

## [](#_scheduled_publishing)Scheduled publishing

You can schedule publishing to a future date and include approval steps. The editor who launches the publication workflow can add a comment for the reviewer and set a publication date.

Publishers receive a task in the Tasks app. They can assign the task to themselves and approve or reject it. The system can also show what changed on the page.

## [](#_publishing_changes_only)Publishing changes only

When you publish a node and its children you often end up publishing content whose status is already Published. Such nodes don’t need to be published but it is often more convenient to just publish the whole tree than node-by-node.

To improve author instance performance, exclude already-published nodes from the action. Publish modified nodes only. This may help performance and scalability in cases where the author instance has a high concurrent load (many editors activating large amounts of content at the same time).

Publish modified nodes only

You can tweak your `pages-app.yaml` file to only publish modified nodes. See [Publishing changes only](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Publishing/Publishing-configuration/) for instructions.

## [](#_publishing_campaigns)Publishing campaigns

You can publish and control every aspect of a campaign using the Campaign Publisher module. Make a campaign, then add pages, assets, and other dependant content to the campaign, such as configuration, and click **Publish**.

Head over to the [Campaign Publisher](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Campaign-Publisher/) to read more about it.
