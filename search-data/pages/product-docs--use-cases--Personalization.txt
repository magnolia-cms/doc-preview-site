# Personalization

![useCase personalization](../../_images/features/useCase-personalization.jpg)

Personalization means adapting content to the visitor according to his or her personal preferences, needs and capabilities. A personalized website is more relevant and engaging than a static non-personalized site. Personalization turns a static pull experience into an interactive push relationship - the visitor indicates their interest and the website pushes matching content. Of all possible content `variants` that could be offered, personalization helps you serve the content that fits best. Tailor content to the visitor so you have a better chance of making a sale or persuading the visitor to stay longer.
