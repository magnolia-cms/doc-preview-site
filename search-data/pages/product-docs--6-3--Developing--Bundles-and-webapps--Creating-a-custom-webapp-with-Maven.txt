# Creating a custom webapp with Maven

This tutorial explains how you can create custom Magnolia webapps with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Using Maven allows you to customize your webapps with the POM files, which can be tracked with a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) like [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). A tailored webapp makes building and deploying faster and has a positive impact on the performance of your instances. With Maven, you can streamline your Magnolia project to meet the specific demands of the project.

> **Tip:** If you just want to try out Magnolia, follow the tutorial called 4.x@magnolia-cli:ROOT:how-to-get-and-adapt-a-bundle-with-magnolia-cli.adoc. Note that this is a CLI v4 tutorial.

## [](#_what_is_a_webapp)What is a webapp

A Java Web Application (webapp) is a collection of servlets, other Java classes, static resources such as HTML pages, other resources, and meta information that describes the webapp bundled together. You can run a webapp on a servlet container. A Java webapp has a typical structure.

It can be packaged as a [WAR file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_%28file_format%29). A webapp usually contains already packed portions called libraries or modules as [JAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_%28file_format%29) files.

Magnolia provides several preconfigured webapps and bundles. Some of them are ideal candidates as a starting point to build your custom webapp.

| Artifact | Download | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `magnolia-tomcat-barebone` | [Nexus](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/#browse/search/maven=attributes.maven2.artifactId%3Dmagnolia-tomcat-barebone) | A preconfigured Tomcat server ready to be used with any Magnolia webapp. |

## [](#_requirements)Requirements

We assume that you are familiar with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and the basics of [POM](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html) files. Your Maven settings should comply with the Magnolia [Maven setup](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Development-environment/Maven/), which provides access to the [Magnolia Nexus](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/) repositories, and thus ensures that you can build the webapps described in the examples. If you are new to Magnolia, we recommend that you first carefully follow the [Magnolia Maven setup^](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Development-environment/Maven/) page.

When creating a custom webapp, you have to decide whether your webapp will contain DX Core modules or only Community Edition modules. If you go for the DX Core, you need credentials to access the DX Core repositories on Nexus and you also need a DX Core license to run the DX Core webapps. If you don’t have these credentials yet, but want to try out the Magnolia DX Core, [apply for a trial license](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/developer-trial.html).

## [](#_possible_approaches)Possible approaches

This section describes two approaches to define a custom webapp with Maven. For both of them, keep in mind the following:

To create a custom Magnolia webapp, always start with a *preconfigured* Magnolia webapp.

### [](#_a_minimal_webapp_and_adding_modules)A minimal webapp and adding modules

If your aim is a minimalistic webapp, we recommend using the `magnolia-empty-webapp` as a base for your webapp project. it is also the base for every Magnolia webapp and provides the essentials such as the Core and UI modules. This approach is applied on the subpage [Creating a minimal webapp with Maven](Creating-a-minimal-webapp-with-Maven/). It could be suitable for you, if you aim at creating a custom headless instance.

### [](#_a_feature_rich_webapp_and_excluding_modules)A feature-rich webapp and excluding modules

Most of the preconfigured Magnolia webapps come with a feature-rich set allowing you to accomplish a number of different tasks and run complex websites. The most prominent preconfigured Magnolia webapps are these two:

-   `magnolia-community-webapp`

-   `magnolia‑dx-core‑webapp`


In the [Creating a DX Core webapp with Maven](Creating-a-DX-Core-webapp-with-Maven/) part of this tutorial, the `magnolia-dx-core-webapp` is used as a starting point. We then exclude some modules which are not necessary for the example use case.

When creating a feature-rich webapp, you cannot only exclude modules, you also need to add additional modules. Usually, it is common to do both, exclude and add modules.

#### [](#_procedure_overview)Procedure overview

1.  Create a webapp skeleton from a Magnolia Maven archetype.

2.  Modify the POM files according to your needs.

3.  Add additional resources, if necessary.

4.  Build the webapp.


| Parameter | Sample | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `groupId` | `com.example` | It typically reflects the name or domain of your company or projects. |
| `artifactId` | `custom-project-minimal` | Project-specific identifier. |
| `version` | `1.0-SNAPSHOT` | Project version. Typically, when creating a new project, use the value suggested, `1.0-SNAPSHOT` . |
| `package` | `com.example` | Package name for Java classes reflecting both your company (or domain) and the specific project. ** For this archetype, this parameter is not used, but you must provide a value. You can use the value proposed by the archetype script. | ** | For this archetype, this parameter is not used, but you must provide a value. You can use the value proposed by the archetype script. |
| ** | For this archetype, this parameter is not used, but you must provide a value. You can use the value proposed by the archetype script. |
| `magnolia-bundle-version` | `6.3.21` | The Magnolia version from which your custom project inherits. If you are unsure, use the latest released version (see releases). ** This version is used in the dependencyManagement section of the created POM files.
