# Backing up and restoring

This page and its subpages explain how to backup and restore data in a cloud-based Magnolia package.

-   Magnolia automatically creates backups for the Live environment, but you also can [create a backup manually](Creating-a-backup-manually/).

-   You can always [recover the Live environment](Recovering-the-Live-environment/).

-   See [Upgrading Magnolia in the cloud](../../managing-updates-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Upgrading-Magnolia-in-the-cloud/) for information about automatic backups created during the upgrade process for Live environments.

## [](#_what_data_is_backed_up)What data is backed up?

When a backup is executed, the following data is saved from the Live environment in its current state:

-   Magnolia software custom **configuration** (JCR data form the workspaces `configuration`, `users`, `userroles`, `usergroups`).

-   Editor created customer **content** (JCR data from content workspaces such as, `website`, `dam`, `category`, `contacts`, and so on).

-   The **release version number** (saved as metadata).

-   The Magnolia **software version number** (saved as metadata).


> **Note:** This applies to both for automatic and manual backups.

## [](#_when_is_data_backed_up)When is data backed up?

Different events trigger the creation of backups:

-   Automatic backups are made on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis between `00:00 - 01:00 UTC` when we assume site traffic is at a minimum. Contact the [Cloud Helpdesk](https://mgnl.io/cloud-helpdesk) to change this time to suit your site.

-   When you [create a manual backup](Creating-a-backup-manually/).

-   When you [upgrade the version of Magnolia in a Live environment](../../managing-updates-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Upgrading-Magnolia-in-the-cloud/).


## [](#_how_many_backups_are_kept)How many backups are kept?

The system keeps the most recently created backup for each type:

-   One monthly backup

-   One weekly backup

-   One daily backup

-   One manually created backup


> **Tip:** If you need more backups stored, contact the Cloud Helpdesk to find an arrangement.
