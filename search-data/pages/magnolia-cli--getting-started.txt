# Magnolia CLI v5

This page describes the Magnolia CLI v5, its core components, and how to install it.

## [](#_plugin_based_cli)Plugin-based CLI

Magnolia CLI in version v5 is a **plugin-based** system. The purpose of this architecture is to offer developers enhanced flexibility, control, customization of commands by [creating a plugin](../plugins/developing-plugins/creating-plugins/), and definition of their own [project templates](jumpstarting/projectTemplates/).

-   **The CLI itself** provides the core functionality and oversees the operation of the plugins. It uses a configuration file called `mgnl.config.js`, where you can configure the logger and the plugins.

-   **The plugins** specified in this file are loaded by the CLI. To meet the requirements of your project, you can modify the file to use it with your own plugin collection.


## [](#_available_plugins)Available plugins

For a list of all plugins, see the [Plugins](../plugins/).

### [](#_pre_installed_plugins)Pre-installed plugins

Several of the plugins are pre-installed:

-   [Jumpstart plugin](../plugins/available-plugins/jumpstart-plugin/) - allows you to download a project.

-   [Generate plugin](../plugins/available-plugins/generate-plugin/) - allows you to generate a new plugin template.


### [](#_the_add_plugin)The `add-plugin`

The CLI also comes with the `add-plugin` command, which installs and registers a new plugin within your project.

> **Note:** Rather than a plugin, it’s more appropriate to view the add-plugin as a command, because it’s always available, even if a local mgnl.config.js exists.

## [](#_installing_cli)Installing CLI

### [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

#### [](#_node_js)Node.js

The Magnolia CLI tool requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). To check the version of your `node.js` installation, run the following command in a shell:

```console
node -v
```

Node.js provides two branches, `LTS` (recommended for long-term support) and `Current` (providing the latest features).

Make sure you are running the latest version of the `LTS` branch. You can get it from [Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download). It may also be [installed via package managers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

#### [](#_java)Java

Java is only required if you want to use the [Start plugin](../plugins/available-plugins/start-plugin/), which starts Magnolia.

For Java installation details, see [Get Java](../../product-docs/6.3/Developing/Magnolia-front-end-development/Install-Magnolia/#_get_java).

### [](#_installing)Installing

We recommend you use the [Jumpstart plugin](../plugins/available-plugins/jumpstart-plugin/) or install the Magnolia CLI locally at project level. This approach allows each project to:

-   maintain its unique configuration within the `mgnl.config.js` file,

-   have separate plugins per project, and

-   to manage different versions of the CLI and the plugins more effectively.


#### [](#_through_the_jumpstart_plugin)Through the jumpstart plugin

This following command prompts you to choose a project template, automatically installs the CLI locally at the project level, and sets up the required files (`package.json` and `mgnl.config.js`) for you.

```console
npx @magnolia/cli@latest jumpstart [name]
```

#### [](#_locally)Locally

To install the latest production version locally at the project level, do the following:

1.  Initialize the project if it’s not already set up:

    ```console
    npm init -y
    ```

2.  Install the Magnolia CLI package:

    ```console
    npm install @magnolia/cli
    ```

3.  Add the following script to `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "scripts": {
        ...
        "mgnl": "node node_modules/@magnolia/cli"
      }
    }
    ```

4.  In `package.json`, set the `type` property to `module`:

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "type": "module"
    }
    ```

5.  Create the `mgnl.config.js` file, where you can configure your plugins:

    ```js
    export default {
      plugins: [],
      logger: {
        filename: "./mgnl.error.log",
        fileLevel: "warn",
        consoleLevel: "debug"
      }
    };
    ```


#### [](#_globally)Globally

To install the latest production version globally, run the following command:

```console
sudo npm install @magnolia/cli -g (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The `sudo` part of the command may be required on Linux or macOS, depending on your permissions and the Node.js installation location. |

### [](#_which_versions_are_available)Which versions are available?

To display a list of released versions of Magnolia CLI, enter the following command in a shell:

```console
npm view @magnolia/cli versions
```

Besides a version list, the following command shows additional information about the Magnolia CLI package:

```console
npm view @magnolia/cli
```

### [](#_testing_the_installation)Testing the installation

To verify that the CLI has been successfully installed and to learn what it offers, use the following flags based on the type of installation.

#### [](#_locally_2)Locally

> **Note:** Prerequisite configurationThe CLI is installed in the project folder and the following is in the package.json file:{
>   "scripts": {
>     "mgnl": "node node_modules/@magnolia/cli"
>   }
> }

##### [](#_help)Help

```console
npm run mgnl -- -h
```

> **Caution:** Windows users using PowerShell must enclose the two consecutive hyphens (--) in quotes:npm run mgnl "--" ...

##### [](#_version)Version

```console
npm run mgnl -- -V
```

> **Caution:** Windows users using PowerShell must enclose the two consecutive hyphens (--) in quotes:npm run mgnl "--" ...

#### [](#_globally_2)Globally

##### [](#_help_2)Help

```console
mgnl -h
```

##### [](#_version_2)Version

```console
mgnl -V
```

### [](#_updating)Updating

#### [](#_locally_3)Locally

To update the CLI installed locally, run the following `npm` command in your project directory.

```console
npm update @magnolia/cli
```

#### [](#_globally_3)Globally

To update the CLI installed globally, run the following `npm` command:

```console
sudo npm update @magnolia/cli -g (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The `sudo` part of the command may be required on Linux or macOS, depending on your permissions and the `Node.js` installation location. |

## [](#_initializing_an_existing_project)Initializing an existing project

### [](#_the_init_command)The `init` command

The CLI comes with the `init` command, which initializes a Magnolia CLI project in your current directory. It automatically detects your project type and configures the necessary files and dependencies.

> **Note:** The init command helps you quickly set up the package.json, install the CLI, and create the mgnl.config.js file. For more details, see Init command for project initialization.

## [](#_adding_plugins)Adding plugins

To expand CLI’s capabilities, see [the available plugins](../plugins/) and [add them](../plugins/managing-plugins/) as needed.

**Example:**

```console
npm run mgnl -- add-plugin @magnolia/cli-start-plugin
```

> **Caution:** Windows users using PowerShell must enclose the two consecutive hyphens (--) in quotes:npm run mgnl "--" ...

This command adds the [Start plugin](../plugins/available-plugins/start-plugin/) to your CLI setup, making the `npm run mgnl -- start` command available for starting up the local Magnolia instance.

> **Tip:** To list all registered commands, execute:npm run mgnl

You’re now ready to use Magnolia CLI v5 locally in your project!
