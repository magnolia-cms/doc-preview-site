# Designing an app

To design a great Magnolia app, there are important things you should know about the platform and user experience.

## [](#_app)App

A Magnolia app is a focused tool that lets editors work on one task at a time. An app can perform a task such as editing a page or manage content such as products. [Create your own apps](../../My-first-content-app/) to do tasks that are important on your site.

All apps are implemented using the [app framework](../App-framework/), whether they are native apps that ship with Magnolia or your own apps. For example, if you want to provide authors a feature that would allow them to manage books for their book shop, you would build a new app to add this functionality to Magnolia.

When designing an app, the most important people to consider are those who will use regularly. The design choices you make will dramatically affect how happy and productive users are with your app.
