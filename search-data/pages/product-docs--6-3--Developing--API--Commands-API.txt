# Commands API

This page describes the `commands` endpoint, which can be used to trigger [commands](../../Commands/) defined in [catalogs](../../Commands/#_catalogs).

Magnolia uses commands to publish and unpublish content, send email, flush cache, take backups, import and export data and for many other tasks.

The commands:

-   Can perform duties within the system or connect to external resources.

-   Are typically executed by [actions](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Support/Magnolia-5-UI-documentation/Dialog-definition-5-UI/Dialog-action-definition-5-UI.adoc) or scheduled for execution by the [Scheduler module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Scheduler-module/).


> **Caution:** The REST resource must be called with HTTP POST.

You can only call commands via REST which are whitelisted at `/modules/rest-services/rest-endpoints/commands/enabledCommands`. For further details see [REST module configuring the commands endpoint](#3.1@rest:ROOT:index.adoc#_commands_endpoint) and [REST security](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/REST-module/REST-security/).

## [](#_request_urls)Request URLs

The endpoint recognizes URLs with or without a catalog parameter.
