# Security

The **Security** section of the Cockpit provides a place to configure important security parameters for your site’s deployment such as metrics on the Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## [](#_webapp_firewall)Webapp firewall

Web Application Firewalls, or WAFs, protect web applications from common malicious attacks such as cross-site-scripting (XSS) and SQL injections. Essentially, they act as a type of wall or shield between your web application and the internet. If you have your own CDN for your project, you’ll likely have your own WAF.

If you choose to go with the default CDN for DX Cloud, you’ll be protected with the [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) WAF.

The Fastly WAF inspects the web traffic at the HTTP application layer by looking at all HTTP and HTTPS requests (both header and body included). This can be configured specifically for your deployment.

## [](#_view_webapp_firewall_information)View Webapp firewall information

To view passed, logged, and blocked requests for your WAF:

1.  Go to **Security > Webapp firewall**.

2.  Select the desired **Cluster Id** from the dropdown list.

3.  Select the desired **Domain Name** from the dropdown list.

4.  Select the **Range** for the statistics.


See the [Webapp firewall graphs](#_webapp_firewall_graphs) below for more details on each metric.

| Metric | Description and Visual |
| --- | --- |
| **Total requests** | Displays the total requests to the WAF in the specified time period. |
| **Total blocked requests** | Displays the total blocked requests to the WAF in the specified time period. |
| **Total requests per WAF status** | Displays the total requests broken down by WAF status. ** This is not for the specified period, but the total requests over time. • `PASSED` = Passed by the WAF and sent to the origin server. • `LOGGED` = Logged by the WAF and sent to the origin server. • `BLOCKED` = Blocked by the WAF. | ** | This is not for the specified period, but the total requests over time. |
| ** | This is not for the specified period, but the total requests over time. |
| **Total requests per WAF status over time** | Displays the total requests broken down by WAF status by the time period. ** This **is** for the specified period, and you can drag over the graph to get even more granular results. • `PASSED` = Passed by the WAF and sent to the origin server. • `LOGGED` = Logged by the WAF and sent to the origin server. • `BLOCKED` = Blocked by the WAF. | ** | This **is** for the specified period, and you can drag over the graph to get even more granular results. |
