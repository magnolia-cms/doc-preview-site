# Rich text field

The rich text field (`RichTextFieldDefinition`) is powered by [CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/index.html). It is a [custom Magnolia field](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/Custom-fields/). The field properties allow you to configure some CKEditor features in the rich text field.

> **Note:** This rich text field definition is part of the Magnolia 6 UI framework. The fully qualified class name is info.magnolia.ui.field.RichTextFieldDefinition.

## [](#_ckeditor_4_migration_to_ckeditor_5)CKEditor 4 migration to CKEditor 5

> **Warning:** CKEditor 4 is End-of-Life (EOL) since 2023 (at ckeditor.com). It’s no longer maintained and doesn’t receive security updates.In Magnolia, it is deprecated (and in the maintenance mode) since the Magnolia 6.4.2 release, which brought the upgrade of the CKEditor 5 to version 47.3.The preferred option in Magnolia is to use CKEditor 5.

Magnolia 6.2 uses CKEditor 4 in its rich text field. Magnolia 6.4 is released with CKEditor 5. While most field properties from Magnolia 6.2 are supported, CKEditor 4 and CKEditor 5 are very different in their [core architecture](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/migration-from-ckeditor-4.html#differences-between-ckeditor-4-and-ckeditor-5). For this reason, Magnolia recommends previewing any content transferred from CKEditor 4 in Magnolia 6.2 and checking that the content is published as you want it.

In particular, you should check their compatibility tables for [configuration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/ckeditor4-configuration-compatibility.html) and [plugins](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/ckeditor4-plugin-compatibility.html) to determine which content might be affected. Furthermore, follow their [migration guidelines](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/migration-from-ckeditor-4.html) to ensure a smooth transition of any content.

### [](#_plugins_in_the_magnolia_ckeditor5_build)Plugins in the Magnolia `ckeditor5-build`

For a list of plugins included in the Magnolia `ckeditor5-build`, see [`ckeditor5.ts`](https://gitlab.com/magnolia-ce/ckeditor5-plugins/-/blob/main/packages/ckeditor5-build/src/ckeditor5.ts?ref_type=heads).

## [](#_rich_text_vs_light_rich_text_field)Rich text vs light rich text field

Alternatively, if you’re considering using a Rich text field as part of a blog post template, consider using a Light rich text field. The [Light rich text field](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Editor-module/Light-rich-text-field/) is a special type of rich text field provided by the [Content Editor module](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Editor-module/). Compared to the rich text field, the light rich text field has limited formatting functions. In addition, the field can only be used as a [content block](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/Developing-an-app/Developing-a-custom-content-editor-app/Developing-and-rendering-custom-content-blocks/) in a [custom content editor](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/Developing-an-app/Developing-a-custom-content-editor-app/).

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ckEditorVersion` | **optional** , *default is CKEDITOR_5* This property sets the version of CKEditor. You don’t need to add it to your field definitions in Magnolia 6.4. ** You must check the [migration recommendations](#_ckeditor_4_migration_to_ckeditor_5) when migrating rich text field definitions from Magnolia 6.2. In particular, the `configJsFile` [property](#_field_properties) is deprecated in Magnolia 6.4. | ** | You must check the [migration recommendations](#_ckeditor_4_migration_to_ckeditor_5) when migrating rich text field definitions from Magnolia 6.2. In particular, the `configJsFile` [property](#_field_properties) is deprecated in Magnolia 6.4. |
| ** | You must check the [migration recommendations](#_ckeditor_4_migration_to_ckeditor_5) when migrating rich text field definitions from Magnolia 6.2. In particular, the `configJsFile` [property](#_field_properties) is deprecated in Magnolia 6.4. |
| `alignment` | **optional** , *default is false* Allows text alignment for paragraphs. When `true` , this property adds alignment buttons (left, center, right, and justify) to the toolbar. |
| `colors` | **optional** Colors displayed in the color selector. Comma-separated hexadecimal color codes without the `#` prefix (for example, `00923E,F8C100,28166F` ). |
| `fonts` | **optional** List of font names displayed in the font selector. Separate entries with a semi-colon (for example, `Arial,sans-serif;Times New Roman,serif` ). It is possible to have more than one font for each entry separated by a comma. A display name may be optionally defined by prefixing the entries with the name and the slash character. Your browser selects the nearest supported font from the font family’s list to render the text. Alternatively, you can use the [font plugin’s default values](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_font_fontconfig-FontFamilyConfig.html#member-options) . For example, when you want to load a list of default fonts, define an empty string in the definition. `$type: richTextField fonts: ""` |
| `fontSizes` | **optional** List of fonts sizes displayed in the font selector. Separate entries with a semi-colon (for example, `16/16px;24/24px;48/48px` ). Any CSS-supported size can be used (for example, `12px` , `2.3em` , `130%` , `tiny` , `small` , `big` , or `huge` ). A display name may be optionally defined by prefixing the entries with the name and the slash character. For example, `Bigger Font/14px` will be displayed as **Bigger Font** in the list and outputted as `14px` . |
| `height` | **optional** , *default is -1* Height of the field (including the toolbar). This property accepts an integer (to denote a value in pixels). Value of `-1` means that the component will take the minimum necessary space. |
| `images` | **optional** , *default is false* Allows images from the DAM. When `true` , this property adds an image button to the toolbar. The user can define the size and alignment of the image and some metadata. |
| `lists` | **optional** , *default is true* Allows bulleted and numbered lists. When `false` , this property removes list buttons from the toolbar. |
| `source` | **optional** , *default is false* Allows toggling between text and HTML editing. When `true` , this property adds a source button to the toolbar. |
| `tables` | **optional** , *default is false* Allows tables. When `true` , this property adds a table button to the toolbar. |
| `linkFieldDefinitions` | **optional** List of JCR or DAM [link field](../Link-field/) definitions. It can be used to provide custom chooser dialogs. Example configuration `linkFieldDefinitions: website: $type: pageLinkField dam: $type: damLinkField` |
| `editorType` | **optional** Use this property to specify which editor you want to use from the ones configured in your [custom build](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/CKEditor5-customization/#_using_a_custom_build) , for example, `BalloonEditor` or `ClassicEditor` . |

## [](#_decode_ckeditor_output_text)Decode CKEditor output text

If the content from a rich text field is not decoded, you can see the HTML tags when previewing the page in Magnolia. When the content is decoded in the respective FTL file, the content is displayed without the HTML elements.

![Rich text content decoded](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/richText_decoded.png)

CKEditor produces HTML such as `<p>` elements for paragraphs. However, text stored in JCR usually escapes HTML code. To render text that originates from a rich text field, you need to decode the stored content to make sure the HTML tags are rendered properly again.

Here is how to decode the `content` object in your FTL file and get the desired property from it:

```xml
${cmsfn.decode(content).text!""}
```

See [`cmsfn`: Decode HTML](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-scripts/Templating-functions/cmsfn/#_decode_html) for more information.

## [](#_customization)Customization

For more details, see [CKEditor 5 customization](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/CKEditor5-customization/). If you are using CKEditor 4 for customization, set the [ckEditorVersion property](#_field_properties) to `CKEDITOR_4` and follow the [CKEditor 4 customization documentation](../../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/CKEditor-customization/) on creating a CKEditor configuration file.

> **Caution:** You can’t currently use CKEditor 4 and CKEditor 5 in the same webapp because it may lead to unpredictable behavior. For example, if you edit a CKEditor field, its toolbar might not display until the page refreshes.
