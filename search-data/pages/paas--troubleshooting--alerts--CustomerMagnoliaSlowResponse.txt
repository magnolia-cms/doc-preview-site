# Magnolia author or public slow response

## [](#_symptom)Symptom

A `CustomerMagnoliaAuthorSlowResponse` alert is firing or a `CustomerMagnoliaPublicSlowResponse` alert is firing. Both alerts use the same metrics but with different thresholds:

-   The author instance is slow responding if the average response time for 90% of requests is more than 2 seconds

-   A public instance is slow responding if the average response time for 90% of requests is more than 0.8 seconds


> **Note:** CustomerMagnoliaAuthorSlowResponse and CustomerMagnoliaPublicSlowResponse alerts are sent to subscribers via email.

| **Expression** | `mgnl_filterChain_duration_seconds{component="author-instance",quantile="0.9"} > 2` |
| --- | --- |
| **Delay** | `15` minutes |
| **Labels** | `team: customer` |
| **Annotations** | • `summary` • `description` • `tenant` • `cluster_id` • `cluster_name` • `pod` • `instance` • `namespace` |

| Cause | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **High request volume** | Check the rate of requests to Magnolia. |
| **Insufficient memory** | Check the memory allocation for the Magnolia pod and the JVM max heap setting. |
| **Excessive garbage collection** | Check for frequent garbage collection and how close and how frequently the JVM heap used is to the JVM max heap. |
| **Magnolia cache is underutilized** | Check the Magnolia cache hit percentage. |
| **Custom filter bottleneck** | Check for custom filters in the filter chain. |
| **Slow requests per type** | Turn on detailed response time metrics and check for slow requests by type (e.g., `resources` , `images` , `pages` ). |
