# Authors

The **Orchestrate module** helps plan and manage content-related tasks and campaigns in a structured manner. It provides tools for task creation, tracking, and visualization, allowing you to organize your content workflow. You can plan tasks, track your progress, and organize them into campaigns, all while utilizing interactive UI components like calendars and task boards for better planning and task management.

**Content Watch** extends Orchestrate module with AI-powered content idea generation. Monitor external URLs — such as competitor blogs, industry publications, or partner websites — and automatically generate content ideas that become tasks in Orchestrate module. Content Watch works entirely through Smart Chat, requiring no additional setup for authors.

## [](#_recurring_tasks)Recurring Tasks

Tasks can be configured to repeat automatically based on a schedule. When you set a recurrence on a task:

1.  The original task becomes the "parent" task

2.  Instance tasks are automatically generated for each occurrence within the campaign duration

3.  Updating the parent’s recurrence regenerates all instances

4.  Deleting the parent removes all associated instances


This is useful for tasks like weekly status meetings, monthly reports, or daily content reviews.
