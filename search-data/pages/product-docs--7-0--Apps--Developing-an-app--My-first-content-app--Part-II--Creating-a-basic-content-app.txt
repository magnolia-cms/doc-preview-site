# My first content app Part II

## [](#_creating_a_basic_content_app)Creating a basic content app

This page is the second part of the [My first content app](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/Developing-an-app/My-first-content-app/) tutorial and describes how to configure and create a basic Bookshelf, a Magnolia content app.

The configuration is done using Magnolia content types – formal definitions for types of content in Magnolia including the properties the type may contain and its relationships to other types of content.

### [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

For development and testing, you need a running [instance](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Instances/) of Magnolia. In this tutorial, we suppose that it’s installed in a directory called `magnolia`.

> **Note:** If you don’t have Magnolia installed and running, go to Installing Magnolia and complete the installation steps. Then, return and proceed from here.

### [](#_creating_the_bookshelf_light_module)Creating the `bookshelf` light module

Magnolia [light modules](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/Light-modules/) usually define page, area and component [templates](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/) and many more things.

In this tutorial, we use a light module called `bookshelf` to create a content app. The module contains both a definition of content types and the [app descriptor](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/App-configuration/App-descriptor/).

1.  Navigate to:

    1.  The `light-modules` folder of your Magnolia installation, if you installed your Magnolia via Magnolia CLI.

    2.  To the `../webapps/magnoliaAuthor/modules` folder, if you unpacked and started your Magnolia from a donwloadable bundle.

        > **Note:** In this case, make sure that whatever light module code changes described below you introduce to this folder, you also apply to the ../webapps/magnoliaAuthor/modules folder.


2.  Create a new folder named `bookshelf`.

3.  Inside the `bookshelf` folder, create the following folder structure:

    > **Note:** Skip this step if you installed your Magnolia via Magnolia CLI.

    ```text
    bookshelf
    ├── apps
    ├── contentTypes
    └── i18n
    ```


### [](#_creating_the_app_configuration_files)Creating the app configuration files

In the `bookshelf` light module, you need to create two configuration files:

-   An app descriptor in the `apps` folder

-   A content type definition in the `contentTypes` folder


#### [](#_creating_the_content_type_definition)Creating the content type definition

1.  In the `contentTypes` folder, create a file named `book.yaml`.

2.  Save it with the following content:

    book.yaml (content type definition)

    ```yaml
    datasource: (1)
      $type: jcrContentTypeDatasource
      workspace: books
      namespaces:
        lib: https://www.magnolia-travel.com/jcr/1.0/lib
      autoCreate: true

    model: (2)
      nodeType: lib:book
      properties: (3)
        - name: authors
        - name: ed (4)
          type: Boolean
        - name: title
        - name: description
        - name: publisher
        - name: publish_date (5)
          type: Date
        - name: isbn13
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Defines how the content type items are persisted. |

    > **Note:** For more details see the Content type Data source definition page.

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Defines the node type and the properties of the new content item for the Bookshelf app. |
    | **2** | Defines the app properties. |

    > **Note:** Defaults to the String type if no other type is supplied.

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Set the type of the `ed` property to `Boolean` since it is more appropriate in regard to the values the system can store (`true`, `false`). |
    | **2** | Set the data type of the `publish_date` property to `Date` so that the value would be stored in the JCR as calendar object. |


> **Note:** The content type definition creates a new workspace called books where all book items will be stored. The autoCreate: true setting ensures that this workspace is automatically created when Magnolia starts.

#### [](#_creating_the_app_descriptor)Creating the app descriptor

1.  In the `apps` folder, create a file named `bookshelf-app.yaml`.

2.  Save it with the following content:

    bookshelf-app.yaml (app descriptor)

    ```yml
    !content-type:book (1)
    name: bookshelf-app (2)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | The app descriptor instructs the app generator to construct the app from the `book` content type definition. |
    | **2** | You give the app the name `bookshelf-app`, under which the app is known to other resources and systems in Magnolia. |


The final folder structure of your `bookshelf` light module should look like this:

```text
bookshelf
├── apps
│   └── bookshelf-app.yaml
├── contentTypes
│   └── book.yaml
└── i18n
```

#### [](#_check_the_app_in_the_definitions_app)Check the app in the Definitions app

After saving the changes, start or restart your Magnolia instance. Then, go to the [Definitions app](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Definitions-app/) on the author instance to check that the app’s definitions have been loaded by Magnolia (the `bookshelf-app` should appear in the `apps` folder).

In case the `bookshelf-app` isn’t there or there’s a problem notification next to it, please double-check that all your `yaml` files have been copied exactly as they appear in this tutorial.

### [](#_starting_the_app)Starting the app

Magnolia adds a tile for your new app to the **App launcher** automatically when registering the app.

![App launcher tile](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-3-partIICreatingABasicContentApp-appInLauncher.png)

> **Note:** i18n message keys and the Name, Title and Description labelsThe magnolia-ui-framework module already contains several generic i18n message keys whose values are applied as labels in the UI of the Bookshelf app.In the last part of the tutorial, you create new label values in subsection Adding an i18n message bundle.

Congratulations! The content app is up and running now.

**Continue to [My first content app Part III](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/Developing-an-app/My-first-content-app/Part-III---Fine-tuning-a-basic-content-app/), where you fine-tune this raw app to a final form.**
