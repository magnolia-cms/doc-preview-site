## [](#_service_pack_releases)Service Pack releases

Service Pack (SP) releases deliver targeted updates to keep your Magnolia experience smooth and reliable.

Service packs are delivered with the `-sp<n>` suffix (e.g., Magnolia CMS `6.2.55-sp1`).

-   **What’s Included**: Every SP release includes the [DX Core](../Administration/License/#_dx_core) and [Community Edition (CE)](../Administration/License/#_community_edition) versions of Magnolia. We do not release the whole module set unless affected by the specific release.

-   **Why**: This approach prevents any confusion for projects built on CE, ensuring compatibility without bundling unnecessary components.

-   **Expectations**: Check the release notes for each SP to see exactly what’s changed and how it applies to your setup.
