# Commands API

This page describes the `commands` endpoint, which can be used to trigger [commands](../../Commands/) defined in [catalogs](../../Commands/#_catalogs).

Magnolia uses commands to publish and unpublish content, send email, flush cache, take backups, import and export data and for many other tasks.

The commands:

-   Can perform duties within the system or connect to external resources.

-   Are typically executed by or scheduled for execution by the [Scheduler module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Scheduler-module/).


> **Caution:** The REST resource must be called with HTTP POST.

You can only call commands via REST which are whitelisted at `/modules/rest-services/rest-endpoints/commands/enabledCommands`. For further details see [REST module configuring the commands endpoint](../../../../../rest/#_commands_endpoint) and [REST security](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/REST-module/REST-security/).

## [](#_request_urls)Request URLs

The endpoint recognizes URLs with or without a catalog parameter.

POST `/commands/v2/{catalogName}/{commandName}`

POST `/commands/v2/{commandName}`
