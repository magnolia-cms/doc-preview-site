# System probes

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `class` |  | The fully qualified class name of the probe to instantiate. ** The class must implement the `info.magnolia.services.instrumentation.probes.LaunchableProbe` interface. | ** | The class must implement the `info.magnolia.services.instrumentation.probes.LaunchableProbe` interface. |
| ** | The class must implement the `info.magnolia.services.instrumentation.probes.LaunchableProbe` interface. |
| `enabled` | `true` | Flag controlling if the probe is active and can provide measurements ( `true` ) or is disabled and not providing measurements ( `false` ). |

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `class` | Should be `info.magnolia.services.instrumentation.probes.environment.SystemProbe` . | **** |
| `name` | The metric name used by Prometheus. Taken as from the node name when configured. | **** |
| `description` | A description of the metric. |  |
| `properties` | An array of properties names. ** If defined, only system properties matching a defined property name will be collected. | ** | If defined, only system properties matching a defined property name will be collected. |  |
| ** | If defined, only system properties matching a defined property name will be collected. |
| `excludedProperties` | An array of property names to exclude from collection. `excludedProperties` lets you "blacklist" selected properties: any property name in excludedProperties will not be collected and saved. ** If defined, only system properties not matching the excluded properties will be collected. ** You can use both properties and excludedProperties, but any property name listed in excludedProperties will not be collected, even it is also defined in properties (i.e. "blacklisting" a property overrides "whitelisting" a property). | ** | If defined, only system properties not matching the excluded properties will be collected. | ** | You can use both properties and excludedProperties, but any property name listed in excludedProperties will not be collected, even it is also defined in properties (i.e. "blacklisting" a property overrides "whitelisting" a property). |  |
| ** | If defined, only system properties not matching the excluded properties will be collected. |
| ** | You can use both properties and excludedProperties, but any property name listed in excludedProperties will not be collected, even it is also defined in properties (i.e. "blacklisting" a property overrides "whitelisting" a property). |
