# Using MCP tools for translation and metadata

The MCP tools let you translate content and generate SEO metadata using natural language through the [AI Accelerator](../../../ai-accelerator/4.0-alpha/) Smart Chat. You do not need to fill in technical fields manually — the AI agent understands your requests and resolves paths, languages, and parameters automatically.

This page shows you how to:

-   [Translate content instantly](#instant-translation) using the `translation.instant` tool

-   [Generate SEO metadata](#generate-metadata) using the `metadata.generate_localized` tool


## [](#instant-translation)Instant translation

Use the AI Accelerator Smart Chat to translate content. You do not need to fill in technical fields manually — the agent resolves paths and languages from your request.

### [](#_prompt_examples)Prompt examples

Translate a specific page to a target language:

Translate the page /travel/destinations/spain from English to German.

Translate using a specific provider:

Translate /about-us from English to French using DeepL.

Short form (the agent infers the source language from the content):

Translate /products/shoes to Spanish.

### [](#_tips_for_effective_prompts)Tips for effective prompts

-   **Always provide the page path** or mention the page name clearly so the agent can resolve the path.

-   **Specify both source and target languages** for best results. If you omit the source language, the agent may ask you to clarify.

-   **Name the translation provider** only if you want to override the default (`ChatGPT`). Otherwise, the default provider is used automatically.

-   The tool translates all `i18n`\-enabled properties of the node. Non-translatable fields (images, dates) are not affected.


For technical details about the tool, see [Instant Translation Tool](../translation-instant/).
