Deprecated

> **Note:** These dialog types have been deprecated since Magnolia 6.0. They are part of the Magnolia 5 UI framework.For the updated implementations, see Dialog types for Magnolia 6 UI instead.

## [](#_simple_dialog)Simple dialog

Use a simple dialog to collect only few data points. A simple dialog provides limited ways to organize and group fields.

Characteristics:

-   No tab bar (the dialog is composed of one tab).

-   One or more fields.

## [](#_complex_dialog)Complex dialog

Use a complex dialog to collect larger amounts of data. A complex dialog can handle complex, hierarchical data sets and summarize key settings of some or all of its subforms.

Characteristics:

-   Multiple tabs for grouping fields.

-   One or more fields per tab.

## [](#_light_dialog)Light dialog

Use a light dialog as part of the task the user is working on. A light dialog asks for quick input but does not severely interrupt the user.

[Modality level](../../Content-apps-5-UI/Developing-an-app-5-UI/Overlays-and-modality-5-UI/#_level): `light`

Characteristics:

-   Commonly used with actions that require parameters from the user.

-   Only makes sense in the context where the user is working.

-   Displayed modally but does not black out the background.

## [](#_strong_dialog)Strong dialog

Use a strong dialog to collect data from the user. A strong dialog severely interrupts the user because it typically requires more data to be input.

[Modality level](../../Content-apps-5-UI/Developing-an-app-5-UI/Overlays-and-modality-5-UI/#_level): `strong`

Characteristics:

-   Commonly used with more elaborate actions (such as uploading a file).

-   Displayed modally and blacks out the background.

## [](#_choose_dialog)Choose dialog

The target app can also provide a choose dialog. This is an alternative to the usual workbench view and may be better suited for selecting an item. When a choose dialog is configured, it is used instead of the workbench view provided by the browser subapp. For example, the Assets app provides a choose dialog for selecting images. The choose dialog looks like a workbench, but it also provides custom actions for uploading and editing images from the desktop. The definition is in `/modules/dam-app/apps/assets/chooseDialog`.
