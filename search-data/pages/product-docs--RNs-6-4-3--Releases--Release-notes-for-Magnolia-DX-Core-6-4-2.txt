# Release notes for Magnolia DX Core 6.4.2

Delivered on January 26, 2026 • Changelog: [22603](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=22603)

**Magnolia 6.4.2** is centered on platform stability, security, and infrastructure flexibility, highlighted by the introduction of native Azure Blob Storage support for DAM. This integration brings full feature parity with our existing S3 support, allowing you to store heavy asset binaries in your preferred cloud container while maintaining a seamless authoring experience. We have also upgraded the CKEditor 5 to v47, transitioning to modernized installation methods that ensure a more robust and future-proof editing environment.

For developers, this release streamlines maintenance with a new filtering option in the Definitions app, designed to help you quickly isolate and inspect project-specific modules. We have also enhanced the Webhooks module, replacing deprecated parameters with clearer properties for handling request bodies and context to support more complex integrations.

Finally, we have reinforced system integrity through essential security hardening measures across the platform. These improvements include stricter content validation for the HTML component in the Magnolia Templating Kit (MTK) and new depth and complexity limits for GraphQL queries to protect against potential performance vulnerabilities.

## [](#_whats_new)What’s new

### [](#_azure_blob_storage_for_dam)Azure Blob Storage for DAM

We have expanded our decoupled storage architecture to support Azure Blob Storage as a native external storage provider for DAM. This functionality is handled by the new [Azure Blob submodule](../../../../dam/developers/dam-azure-blob/).

Previously available only for AWS S3, this integration allows you to store heavy asset binaries externally in your Azure container while keeping lightweight metadata within the local JCR workspace. This feature achieves full feature parity with our existing S3 integration, ensuring a seamless experience for both developers and content authors.

Key Benefits:

-   Infrastructure flexibility: Support for the two leading cloud providers allows you to align your DAM storage strategy with your existing organizational infrastructure (Azure or AWS).

-   Seamless authoring: The AdminCentral UI remains unchanged; authors interact with assets exactly as they did before, regardless of where the binaries are hosted.

-   Simplified configuration: The setup process for Azure mirrors the established configuration patterns used for S3, reducing the learning curve for system administrators.

## [](#_deprecations)Deprecations

### [](#_ckeditor_4)CKEditor 4

-   [MGNLUI-9344](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9344) Mark CKEditor 4 as deprecated


### [](#_timetolive_property_in_rest)`timeToLive` property in REST

The `timeToLive` configuration property for REST delivery endpoints has been deprecated with this release. Previously, using this property could result in duplicated `Cache-Control` headers.

Caching behavior for endpoints should now be managed centrally via the [Cache modules](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Cache-modules/). To enable caching for REST endpoints, which often utilize URLs without file extensions, you should adjust the `emptyExtensionVote` property in your cache configuration.

To cache REST endpoints, set the `emptyExtensionVote` property to `false` at the following configuration path:

`/modules/cache/config/contentCaching/defaultPageCache/browserCachePolicy/policies/dontCachePages/voters/contentType`

For more configuration details, see [Cache control directives](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Cache-modules/Cache-core/#_cache_control_directives).

-   [MGNLREST-896](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLREST-896) Deprecate the `timeToLive` config for delivery endpoints
