# Magnolia MCP module

[Generative AI](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/generative-ai/) Incubator Version 1.0-SNAPSHOT [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

The **Magnolia MCP module** provides [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) support for Magnolia, enabling bidirectional integration between Magnolia and MCP-compatible AI systems.

With MCP, Magnolia can both consume external AI tools and expose its own capabilities to external AI assistants.

### [](#_model_context_protocol_mcp_integration)Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration

Magnolia MCP integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so your AI assistant can understand your content and take actions based on it, not just generate text.

With MCP in place, editors interact with a familiar Copilot-style chat in Magnolia. Behind the scenes, MCP connects that chat to specialized AI tools and data sources. These tools can read what is in your website, assets, and configurations, and then safely take actions such as improving SEO, creating or updating pages, generating localized versions, or setting up recurring tasks. The MCP integration provides a single interface within Magnolia for content governance while enabling access to a growing catalog of AI capabilities, including external MCP tools (for example, file systems, analytics, or back-office systems) that you can connect without changing the editor experience.

#### [](#_integration_with_ai_accelerator)Integration with AI Accelerator

When combined with the [AI Accelerator module](../ai-accelerator/4.0-alpha/), MCP becomes even more powerful. The AI Accelerator provides content-focused AI tools (component generation, image creation, SEO optimization) that can be exposed through MCP’s standardized protocol. This means external AI assistants can access Magnolia’s content creation capabilities while maintaining proper governance and security.

For example, an external AI assistant could:

-   Generate new page components using AI Accelerator’s templates

-   Create SEO-optimized metadata for existing content

-   Generate localized versions of content for different markets

-   Access Magnolia’s asset management for image generation workflows


The combination enables a comprehensive AI-powered content ecosystem where MCP provides the protocol infrastructure and AI Accelerator delivers the content-specific capabilities.

#### [](#_architecture_overview)Architecture overview

The MCP integration consists of two Magnolia components that enable bidirectional exchange of tools and resources between Magnolia and MCP-compatible systems that are not part of the Magnolia codebase.

Magnolia’s MCP integration has two components that enable bidirectional tool and resource exchange:

-   **[MCP client](developers/mcp-client/)** (inbound flow): Discovers and connects to MCP servers that are not part of the Magnolia codebase, using HTTP/HTTPS or stdio. It caches their capabilities and federates discovered tools and resources into Magnolia’s AI Agent system, enabling your AI assistants to use non-Magnolia tools. Per-agent YAML configuration (`includeMcpServers`, `excludeMcpServers`, `excludeMcpToolPatterns`) controls which MCP servers and tools are exposed to each agent. A REST API (`/.rest/mcp-servers/v1`) lets you inspect connected servers, capabilities, tools, and resources.

-   **[Embedded MCP server](developers/mcp-server/)** (outbound flow): Runs inside Magnolia and exposes MCP tools and Magnolia resources through a JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint at `/.rest/mcp/v1`. This allows non-Magnolia MCP clients (for example, desktop assistants or automation tools) to interact with a Magnolia instance. The server is extensible through Guice multibindings for custom `McpToolProvider` and `McpResourceProvider`.
