# Scaling strategies

## [](#_overview)Overview

Scaling strategies often involve leveraging cloud setups. It’s essential to choose the right kind of infrastructure for your environment. Common concerns about scaling with cloud setups include security and compliance - from firewalls to intrusion detection systems and data compliance to changing regulations.

Another challenge to cloud setups is data migration and the ability to optimize performance as needed. Whether you opt for private, public, or hybrid deployment depends on these challenges and concerns.

> **Tip:** DX Cloud is a digital Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering and includes an out-of-the-box environment management.Thanks to Docker and Kubernetes, you can flexibly scale your environments up or down when experiencing a traffic peak. You can also add regions with a single click.
