# Group and role strategies

There are several ways you can define permissions. You can either have many groups with one role each or only few groups with several roles. From a technical point of view it is more or less the same amount of content. Focus on user friendliness and easy-to-understand groupings instead.

One strategy is to first open access to everything and then close it systematically. The opposite is to first close access to everything and then open it systematically.

| Permission | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Read/Write | `/` |
| Read only | `/home/section1` |
| Read only | `/home/section2` |
| Deny access | `/home/section4` |
