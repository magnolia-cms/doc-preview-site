# GDPR and cookies

This page explains how you can use the Magnolia GDPR features to manage your cookies on your website.

Under GDPR, you must inform visitors that your website is using cookies, and, if your cookies store personal data, ask visitors to consent to their data being collected.

This is an overview of how to handle cookies:

-   Let the website visitor know that your website is using cookies.

-   Ask the website visitor to grant permission for the cookies to be used and store the website visitor’s decision. The website visitor can accept or reject cookies. See [managing consent for cookies](#_managing_consent_for_cookies).

-   [Configure your cookies in the Cookies app](#Configuring cookies with cookies app) according to your cookie consent decision strategy.

-   Before setting a cookie, Magnolia checks the Cookies app for the value of the cookie consent decision and the configuration of the cookie to decide if the cookie may be set. See [Understanding whether a cookie is set or not](#Understanding the cookie setting decision).

-   We recommend you inform your website visitors about what cookies you’re using and about the purpose of the cookies.


Magnolia helps you to implement cookies in compliance with GDPR. It nonetheless remains the responsibility of the website owner to manage cookies properly. The [Privacy module](../) provides the features described on this page.

## [](#_inform_the_website_visitor)Inform the website visitor

You must inform website visitors that you’re using cookies.

> **Tip:** List all the cookies and for what they’re used for.

Example:

![Cookies information page](../../../../_images/6-2-howToHandleCookiesGdpr-cookiesInfoTable.png)

## [](#_types_of_cookie_in_magnolia)Types of cookie in Magnolia

You can set cookies on the server-side using the [Servlet cookie API](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html), or on the client side using [JavaScript cookie API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie). Since Magnolia is server-side software, you can completely control server-side cookies using Magnolia. Magnolia also enables you to have some control over client-side cookies.

### [](#_cookies_set_on_the_server_side)Cookies set on the server-side

Magnolia uses cookies for different features and functions, for example in the visitor trait to serve [personalized content](../../../../use-cases/Personalization/).

To set a cookie on the server-side, Magnolia uses info.magnolia.consent.cookie.CookieManager, which always checks the website visitor’s cookie consent decision before the cookie is set.

### [](#_cookies_set_on_the_client_side_marketing_tags)Cookies set on the client-side - Marketing tags

Many third-party services, such as [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/), [Eloqua](https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/marketing-automation/index.html), and [Clicky](https://clicky.com/), require cookies to work properly. Such third-party cookies are set on the client-side using JavaScript.

Generally speaking, you can’t control cookies set on the client-side with Magnolia. However, the code snippet containing the JavaScript code, which sets the cookie, is added by Magnolia on the server-side By adding or not adding the code snippet, you can control whether the cookie is set or not.

By using the [Marketing Tags app](../../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Marketing-Tags-app/) to manage the code snippets for these third-party services and [defining a cookie in the Cookies app and linking it to the marketing tags item](#Linking marketing tag to cookie definition), you control whether the third-party cookie is set based on the website visitor’s cookie consent decision.

## [](#_managing_consent_for_cookies)Managing consent for cookies

When using the Magnolia GDPR cookie features, Magnolia cookies, and even third-party cookies managed via the [Marketing Tags app](../../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Marketing-Tags-app/), are never set unless the website visitor has given their consent.

Visitor consent for cookie usage must therefore be collected and stored. In Magnolia, consent itself is stored in a cookie named `cookieConsent_status`.

The stored value, if there is one, is used to decide whether other cookies are set or not.

### [](#_variations_of_the_cookie_consent_interaction)Variations of the cookie consent interaction

The simplest cookie consent interaction strategy is to offers visitors the choice between accepting or rejecting cookies. You can implement more complex strategies depending on your requirements.

#### [](#_basic_accept_or_reject_consent)Basic `accept or reject` consent

With this strategy, you inform visitors that cookies exist on your website and ask them to accept.

For example, display a message such as: *This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website* and a button such as **Got it!** so that visitors can accept the usage of cookies.

In this case, you store a simple value such as `accepted` or `OK` as value of the cookie.

#### [](#_consent_for_different_groups_of_cookies)Consent for different groups of cookies

With this strategy, you give the website visitor the possibility to give consent for different groups of cookies:

![Consenting to use of cookies](../../../../_images/5-7-0-howToHandleCookiesGdpr-cookieConsentForm.png)

In this case, you store cookie values such as the following, based on which options the user consents to:

-   `features`

-   `features,marketing`

-   `features,marketing,statistics`

-   `marketing,statistics`


> **Note:** If you are using cookie specification Version 0 (by Netscape), the cookie values must not contain white space, brackets, parentheses, equals signs, commas, double quotes, slashes, question marks, @ signs, colons, and semicolons.Any cookie values that contain illegal characters result in an empty value on server side.If you encounter this issue, we recommend you either use cookie specification Version 1 (by RFC 2109) in your application server, or use different separator such as | (pipe), for example, features|marketing.For more information see https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html.

### [](#_storing_the_cookieconsent_status)Storing the `cookieConsent_status`

You can set the `cookieConsent` cookie via JavaScript. The Magnolia Travel Demo uses a third-party JavaScript library built specifically to deal with cookie consent. See [Osano Cookie Consent](https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent) and the related [Git repository](https://github.com/osano/cookieconsent) for more information.

Alternatively, you can use the Magnolia info.magnolia.consent.cookie.CookieManager to add the cookie on the server-side.

Cookie example

```java
private static final String COOKIECONSENTCOOKIE_ID = "cookiesConsent";
/**
 * Set the consent cookie.
 */
public void setCookieConsentCookie(String cookieConsentStatusValue) {
    if (cookieManager.getCookieDefinition(COOKIECONSENTCOOKIE_ID).isPresent()) {
        CookieDefinition cookieDefinition = cookieManager.getCookieDefinition(COOKIECONSENTCOOKIE_ID).get();
        cookieDefinition.setValue(cookieConsentStatusValue);
        cookieManager.addCookie(cookieDefinition);
    }
}
```

For more information, see [GDPR API - Managing cookies](../../../../Developing/API/Java-Server-APIs/Data-privacy-API/#_getting_cookiemanager).

| cookieConsent_status value | requiredConsentRegexp property(regular expression) | Cookie is set |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `features,marketing,statistics` | `.features.` | ✓ |
| `marketing,statistics` | `.features.` | ✗ |
| `accepted` | `.features.` | ✗ |
| `accepted` | no value* (no value defaults to `.+` ) | ✓ |
