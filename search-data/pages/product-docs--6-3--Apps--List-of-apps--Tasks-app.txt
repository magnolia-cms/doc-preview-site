# Tasks app

The Tasks app is where tasks related to publishing workflows are collected. Users can go to the app to see who owns a task and perform actions on it. To open the app, click the arrow next to **Tasks** in the upper-right corner.

The task counter shows the combined total of new tasks and tasks assigned to the current user. The totals are displayed separately in a tooltip. A green dot only appears next to the counter if there are new tasks.

You can sort tasks by clicking any of the column headers. In the **Status** column, you can filter tasks by [status](#_task_status).

## [](#_tasks)Tasks

Tasks make collaboration better. Magnolia uses [human tasks](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Workflow-module/jBPM-integration/Human-Tasks/) in the publishing [workflow](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Workflow-module/Magnolia-four-eye-workflow/). For example, when an editor publishes a page, the system creates an approval task and sends it to the `publisher` group. Under the hood, we use the jBPM workflow engine’s [user task](https://docs.jbpm.org/7.73.0.Final/jbpm-docs/html_single/#create-user-task-proc) feature. See also [Custom tasks](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Workflow-module/Custom-tasks/) and [User tasks](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Workflow-module/User-tasks/) in Magnolia workflow documentation.

Tasks are a single persisted entry shared by different users and groups. Given appropriate access rights, one or more users can see the same task and its status.

## [](#_task_status)Task status

Tasks can have one of the following statuses:

-   **New**: Tasks waiting to be assigned to a user.

-   **Assigned**: Tasks assigned to a user.

-   **Resolved**: Tasks that were successfully resolved.

-   **Failed**: Tasks that were approved but did not run successfully.

-   **Scheduled**: Tasks scheduled for later publication.

-   **Archived**: Tasks that are archived but still stored in the repository and that can be reopened if necessary.


## [](#_example_tasks_in_the_publishing_workflow)Example tasks in the publishing workflow

This is how tasks work in the Travel Demo. See [Default roles, groups and users](../../../Administration/IAM/Roles-groups-and-users/) for more about permissions assigned to each user.

1.  Eric, a content editor, publishes a page. The task is sent to the `publisher` group. All members of the group can see the new task.

2.  Peter, a content publisher, assigns the task to himself. Other publishers (for example, `superuser`) can see the task and the assignee.

3.  When Peter opens the task, he can:

    -   **Approve & publish**: Publishes the page.

    -   **Reject**: Opens a comment dialog and sends a message to the editor (Eric).

    -   **Preview page**: Opens the page in preview mode in the Pages app.

    -   **Show changes**: Opens the page in [diff view](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Diff-module/) in the Pages app.


4.  Peter approves the request. If the task fails for technical reasons, it can be retried.
