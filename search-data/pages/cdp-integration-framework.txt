# CDP integration framework

[Customer data](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/customer-data/) Unbundled: Framework Version [3.0.1](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/CUSTDP)

Customer Data Platform (CDP) connectors are integral components in the data ecosystem of modern businesses. They serve as bridges between various data sources and the CDP itself, facilitating the seamless flow of data into and out of the platform. Their primary function is to gather, organize, and synchronize customer data from disparate sources such as CRM systems, marketing automation tools, e-commerce platforms, and more.

By aggregating data from multiple touchpoints, CDP connectors enable companies to create a unified view of their customers, allowing for more personalized marketing campaigns, targeted messaging, and improved customer experiences. The benefits of utilizing CDP connectors include enhanced data accuracy, better insights into customer behavior, increased operational efficiency, and ultimately, improved customer engagement and loyalty.
