## [](#_improvements)Improvements

### [](#_automatic_license_retrieval_and_monitoring)Automatic license retrieval and monitoring

Two additions make working with DX Core licenses simpler and safer:

-   Automatic license key retrieval at startup.

    From this release onwards, Magnolia automatically retrieves a license key at startup by checking multiple sources. For more details, see [Updating a license key](../../Administration/License/#_updating_a_license_key). You should use [`magnolia.license.location`](../../Administration/Architecture/Configuration-management/#magnolia-license-location) for more security if required in your environment.

-   Live monitoring of license files.

    Both the `magnolia.license.location` target and the default `${magnolia.home}/license.key` are monitored for changes. Automatic file monitoring refreshes the license without you having to use the UI or restart the application, making it suitable for secret rotation and automated deployments.


For more details, see [License](../../Administration/License/).

[MGNLLIC-121](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLLIC-121), [MGNLLIC-126](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLLIC-126)

## [](#_security_improvements)Security improvements

[BUILD-1471](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/BUILD-1471), [MAGNOLIA-9725](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9725), [MGNLDAM-1828](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-1828)

We keep the details of security fixes private in line with our [security policy](../../Administration/Security/Security-policy/). Stay informed on the latest security updates by subscribing to our Security Announcements list. Contact our [Support team](#support:ROOT:index.adoc) if you need more information.

### [](#_jndi_disabled_by_default)JNDI disabled by default

You are only affected if you configured a custom `contextFactoryClass` or `providerURL` in your `repository.xml` file as these configurations are no longer supported by default.

To use JNDI, set the system property `jackrabbit.jndi.enabled` to `true`.

Example

```sh
export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djackrabbit.jndi.enabled=true"
```

> **Important:** If enabled, ensure repository registration and lookup through JNDI is done through configuration values. Using user supplied values is a potential security risk and should be avoided.

### [](#_interpolated_variables)Interpolated variables

Interpolation of environment variables remains unaltered, but values are now hidden in the Definitions and About apps. If you know the name of an environment variable, you can display its value in the About app; otherwise, you need to find the injected environment variable names in the Resources app first.
