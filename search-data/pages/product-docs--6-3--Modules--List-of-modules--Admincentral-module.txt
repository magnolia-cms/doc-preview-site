The Admincentral module allows you to customize certain functional aspects of the [Find Bar](#_configuring_find_bar_search_results), namely configuration of search filters and sizes of search result collections.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.admincentral</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-admincentral</artifactId>
  <version>6.3.7</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

| --- | --- |
| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

> **Note:** The UI Admincentral is a different module. Its groupId is info.magnolia.ui, and its artifactId is magnolia-ui-admincentral. You can use it to configure, for example, the availability and layout of apps in the App launcher.

## [](#_configuring_find_bar_search_results)Configuring Find Bar search results

You can configure how many search results are displayed. To do so, use the [definition decoration](../../../Developing/Definition-decoration/) mechanism.

For example, the following light module configuration updates the `defaultCountPerSupplier` to `3`, allowing you to see only up to 3 search results.

<my-module>/decorations/admincentral/config.yaml

```yaml
findBar:
   defaultCountPerSupplier: 3
```

### [](#_configurable_properties_for_find_bar_search)Configurable properties for Find Bar search

The table below lists properties in the [Admincentral module](./) that affect how search results appear.

 PropertyDescription

`defaultCountPerSupplier`

**optional**, *default is `10`*

Integer defining the maximum number of search results shown from any single search supplier.

`editorRoles`

**optional**

List of user roles allowed in the **Last editor** search filter:
![List of authorized user roles](../../../_images/6-1-admincentralModule-lastEditor.png)

All users are available unless specified otherwise.

> **Warning:** By allowing all user roles in editorRoles, you may experience performance issues, especially when a large number of public users are registered in a shared user repository on the author instance and you open a Find Bar filter.

`minimumSearchLength`

**optional**, *default is `3`*

Configure the minimum number of necessary characters that are shown in a text hint in the find bar to help the user understand how to use the search feature.

`suppliers`

**optional**

List of search result suppliers. If undefined, it defaults to all suppliers provided by the [Periscope module](../Periscope-module/).

See also [Search result suppliers](../Periscope-module/#_search_result_suppliers).

`supplierOrder`

**optional**, *default is `apps, pages, stories, assets, tours`*

List defining the ordering of search result groups.

## [](#_global_password_policy_validation)Global password policy validation

The Admincentral module provides global password policy validation for all password fields via the ValidatingPasswordFieldDefinition class. This validation is configured in the `ui-framework-core` module and enforces password strength requirements across the system.

The default password policy requires:

-   Minimum 12 characters in length

-   At least one uppercase English letter

-   At least one lowercase English letter

-   At least one digit

-   At least one special character from the set: `#?!@$%^&*-`


This policy is automatically applied to password fields in the [Security app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/) and any other location where password validation is needed.

### [](#_configure_the_password_policy_pattern)Configure the password policy pattern

You can customize the password policy by decorating the `ui-framework-core` module configuration. The `pattern` property uses a regular expression to define password requirements.

To modify the password policy, create a decoration file in your module:

ui-framework-core/config.yaml

```yaml
...
  info.magnolia.ui.field.ValidatingPasswordFieldDefinition$BcryptedPasswordFieldDefinition:
    policy:
      class: info.magnolia.ui.field.RegexpValidatorDefinition
      # Password policy regular expression below:
      ## Password has a minimum of 12 characters in length. Adjust it by modifying {12,}
      ## At least one uppercase English letter. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[A-Z])
      ## At least one lowercase English letter. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[a-z])
      ## At least one digit. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[0-9])
      ## At least one special character. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-])
      pattern: ^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-]).{12,}$
```

You can customize the pattern by:

-   Changing the minimum length by modifying `{12,}` to your desired number

-   Removing character type requirements by deleting the corresponding `(?=.*?[…​])` groups

-   Adding additional special characters to the character set `[#?!@$%^&*-]`


For more details about password field configuration, see [Password field](../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Password-field/).
