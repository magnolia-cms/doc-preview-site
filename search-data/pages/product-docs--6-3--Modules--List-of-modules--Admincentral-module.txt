## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.admincentral</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-admincentral</artifactId>
  <version>{magnolia-admincentral-63}</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

> **Note:** The UI Admincentral is a different module. Its groupId is info.magnolia.ui, and its artifactId is magnolia-ui-admincentral. You can use it to configure, for example, the availability and layout of apps in the App launcher.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `defaultCountPerSupplier` | **optional** , *default is 10* Integer defining the maximum number of search results shown from any single search supplier. |
| `editorRoles` | **optional** List of user roles allowed in the **Last editor** search filter: All users are available unless specified otherwise. ** By allowing all user roles in `editorRoles` , you may experience performance issues, especially when a large number of public users are registered in a shared user repository on the author instance and you open a Find Bar filter. | ** | By allowing all user roles in `editorRoles` , you may experience performance issues, especially when a large number of public users are registered in a shared user repository on the author instance and you open a Find Bar filter. |

## [](#_global_password_policy_validation)Global password policy validation

The Admincentral module provides global password policy validation for all password fields via the ValidatingPasswordFieldDefinition class. This validation is configured in the `ui-framework-core` module and enforces password strength requirements across the system.

The default password policy requires:

-   Minimum 12 characters in length

-   At least one uppercase English letter

-   At least one lowercase English letter

-   At least one digit

-   At least one special character from the set: `#?!@$%^&*-`


This policy is automatically applied to password fields in the [Security app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/) and any other location where password validation is needed.

### [](#_configure_the_password_policy_pattern)Configure the password policy pattern

You can customize the password policy by decorating the `ui-framework-core` module configuration. The `pattern` property uses a regular expression to define password requirements.

To modify the password policy, create a decoration file in your module:

ui-framework-core/config.yaml

```yaml
...
  info.magnolia.ui.field.ValidatingPasswordFieldDefinition$BcryptedPasswordFieldDefinition:
    policy:
      class: info.magnolia.ui.field.RegexpValidatorDefinition
      # Password policy regular expression below:
      ## Password has a minimum of 12 characters in length. Adjust it by modifying {12,}
      ## At least one uppercase English letter. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[A-Z])
      ## At least one lowercase English letter. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[a-z])
      ## At least one digit. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[0-9])
      ## At least one special character. You can remove this condition by removing (?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-])
      pattern: ^(?=.*?[A-Z])(?=.*?[a-z])(?=.*?[0-9])(?=.*?[#?!@$%^&*-]).{12,}$
```

You can customize the pattern by:

-   Changing the minimum length by modifying `{12,}` to your desired number

-   Removing character type requirements by deleting the corresponding `(?=.*?[…​])` groups

-   Adding additional special characters to the character set `[#?!@$%^&*-]`


For more details about password field configuration, see [Password field](../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Password-field/).
