# Groups

Users sharing similar privileges are organized into groups. The purpose of a group is to define the settings for the group as whole rather than for each individual user. Permissions defined at a group level automatically extend to all its members.

When a role is assigned to a group, all users within that group inherit the permissions associated with the role. This eliminates the need to assign individual roles to each user.

Moreover, by assigning additional groups to the current group, users within the current group inherit both the roles and permissions granted to the groups being added.

You can manage groups in the [Security app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/).

1.  In the Groups subapp, select the group you want to edit.

2.  Click **Edit group** in the action bar.

3.  Edit the name, title, and description of the group in the first section of the tab that opens.

4.  In the second section, you can assign other groups to the current group.

5.  In the third section, you can assign roles to the current group.

    > **Tip:** You can duplicate existing groups to speed up creation. The duplicated group is created with all the same permissions as the original, but without any of the members assigned.


## [](#_group_permissions)Group permissions

Select any group and click **Group permissions** or **Group members** in the action bar to view the permissions granted to that group or which users are assigned to that group, respectively.

See the default group permissions in the table.
