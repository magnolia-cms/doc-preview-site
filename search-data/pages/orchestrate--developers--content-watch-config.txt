# Configure Content Watch Tools

The Content Watch tools expose URL monitoring and AI-powered content idea generation as MCP tools through the Magnolia embedded MCP server. These tools are available to [Smart Chat](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) and can be used by authors directly from the Smart Chat chat.

> **Note:** To use Content Watch tools, first install the required Maven dependencies.

For author-facing usage instructions and example prompts, see [Content Watch](../../authors/content-watch/).

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **sourceUrl** | string | Yes | URL of the page to analyze for content ideas. Example: `https://competitor.com/blog/ai-trends` | — |
| **numberOfIdeas** | integer | No | Number of content ideas to generate. | 4 |
| **createTasks** | boolean | Yes | Whether to create tasks in Orchestrate module for the generated ideas. Set to `true` to create tasks, `false` to only return the ideas. | — |

## [](#_architecture)Architecture

The Content Watch tools are split across three modules to separate concerns:

`orchestrate-tool-definitions`

Contains the `ContentWatchTools` class, which is the single source of truth for all tool schemas and command bindings. Each tool is defined as an `McpToolSpec` record (from `magnolia-mcp-protocol`). This module has no Magnolia runtime dependencies and can be shared with the standalone MCP server.

`orchestrate-contentwatch-mcp`

Contains the MCP infrastructure: one `CommandBackedToolExecutor` per tool, a `ContentWatchToolProvider` (provider ID: `content-watch`, priority: `100`), and the Guice configuration that registers everything. The provider is auto-discovered when the module is installed alongside `mcp-server-embedded`.

`orchestrate-contentwatch`

Contains the business logic: Magnolia commands (`ContentWatchCommand`, `ScheduleContentWatchCommand`, `ListContentWatchesCommand`, `CancelContentWatchCommand`) and services (`ContentWatchOrchestrationService`, `WebScrapingService`, `ContentIdeaGenerationService`, `TaskCreationService`).

### [](#_execution_flow)Execution flow

1.  An MCP `tools/call` request arrives at the embedded server for a `contentwatch.*` tool.

2.  The `ContentWatchToolProvider` dispatches to the matching `CommandBackedToolExecutor`.

3.  The executor places MCP arguments into a `SimpleContext` and invokes the bound Magnolia command via `CommandsManager`.

4.  The command delegates to domain services (web scraping, AI idea generation, task creation, or scheduler operations).

5.  The result is stored in the command context and returned as a `ToolResult`.


## [](#_extending_with_new_tools)Extending with new tools

To add a new content watch tool:

1.  Define a new `McpToolSpec` in `ContentWatchTools` (tool name, description, input schema, command catalog, command name).

2.  Create the Magnolia command in `orchestrate-contentwatch` that implements the business logic.

3.  Register the command in the YAML command catalog under `contentwatch`.

4.  Create a `CommandBackedToolExecutor` subclass in `orchestrate-contentwatch-mcp` that passes the spec and `CommandsManager`.

5.  Add the executor to the Guice `Multibinder<McpToolExecutor>` in `ContentWatchGuiceModule`.


The new tool is automatically discovered by the embedded MCP server and available to Smart Chat.
