# Workflow processes

jBPM documentation on [Processes](http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v6.0.1/userguide/jBPMBPMN2.html):

> jBPM6 allows you to execute processes defined using the BPMN 2.0 XML format. That means that you can use all the different jBPM6 tooling to model, execute, manage and monitor your business processes using the BPMN 2.0 format for specifying your executable business processes. Actually, the full BPMN 2.0 specification also includes details on how to represent things like choreographies and collaboration. The jBPM project however focuses on that part of the specification that can be used to specify executable processes.
>
> Executable processes in BPMN consist of a different types of nodes being connected to each other using sequence flows. The BPMN 2.0 specification defines three main types of nodes:
>
> -   Events: They are used to model the occurrence of a particular event. This could be a start event (that is used to indicate the start of the process), end events (that define the end of the process, or of that subflow) and intermediate events (that indicate events that might occur during the execution of the process).
>
> -   Activities: These define the different actions that need to be performed during the execution of the process. Different types of tasks exist, depending on the type of activity you are trying to model (e.g. human task, service task, etc.) and activities could also be nested (using different types of sub-processes).
>
> -   Gateways: Can be used to define multiple paths in the process. Depending on the type of gateway, these might indicate parallel execution, choice, etc.
>
>
> jBPM6 does not implement all elements and attributes as defined in the BPMN 2.0 specification. We do however support a significant subset, including the most common node types that can be used inside executable processes.

> **Note:** Please read the whole Processes chapter in jBPM documentation.

## [](#_visual_representation_of_a_process)Visual representation of a process

BPMN2 files are XML files. You can model them in a visual modeler.

Here is a visual representation of a simple process consisting only of start and end events and one executable task.

## [](#_recommended_modeler)Recommended modeler

jBPM can execute any process that is described using the standard BPMN 2.0 XML format. You can use any modeler application that supports the format. As always with standardized formats and their implementations, there are shortcomings no matter which one you choose. At Magnolia we use the [Eclipse BPMN2 modeler plugin.](http://eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `workflows` | **required** The folder which contains a list of workflow definitions. The name of the folder must be `workflows` . |
| `<workflow-name>` | **required** The name of the workflow. The name is arbitrary but must be unique. |
| `id` | **required** Used for identifying processes inside jBPM. |
| `name` | **required** The name used in Magnolia to identify the process. This is called from your command launching the workflow. |
| `resourcePath` | **required** Path to the .bpmn file inside your module’s resource directory. |
| `type` | **required** Magnolia currently only loads processes of type `bpmn` . |
| `definition` | **optional** Instead of using the resource path you can use the XML definition directly. This will override the `resourcePath` . |

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| []() `commandName` | **required** The name of the command to be called upon acceptance from the reviewer. |
| `commandCatalog` | **optional** The name of the catalog where you want to keep the [command](#commandName) . ** For more on this topic, see [Catalogs](../../../../Developing/Commands/#_catalogs) . | ** | For more on this topic, see [Catalogs](../../../../Developing/Commands/#_catalogs) . |
| ** | For more on this topic, see [Catalogs](../../../../Developing/Commands/#_catalogs) . |
| `enabled` | **optional** , *default is true* Enabled or disable the configuration. |
| `parameterMapName` | **required** The name of the map object to be sent to the workflow. See [Input and output parameters](#_input_and_output_parameters) for more details. |
| `path` | **optional** , *default is /* Map the process to a path. |
| `repository` | **optional** , *default is website* Map the process to a path. |
| `workflow` | **required** The name of the workflow to be called. |

## [](#_tutorial)Tutorial

We have put together a [step-by-step tutorial](../Creating-a-custom-workflow-process/) on how to create, load and launch custom process.
