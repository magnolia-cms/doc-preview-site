# Configuring search in Magnolia

By default, Magnolia’s search functionality is provided by the Jackrabbit repository which uses the default Lucene algorithm to calculate the score for ranking results.

> **Tip:** For more advanced search options and especially if you need to manage high volumes of assets, you can set up Magnolia to use Solr search.

Jackrabbit allows you to control which properties of a node are indexed and how much they will affect the `jcr:score` value which represents the full-search score of the node serving as a measure of that node’s relevance to the full-text search expression result. Once those properties are defined in the index configuration file, Lucene calculates how to index the content of a workspace.

| `jcr:score` | Text property |
| --- | --- |
| 1000 | "Apache Jackrabbit" |
| 848 | "some test jackrabbit apache, apache is great" |
| 350 | "this is a text that is much larger than the first one and only contains the word apache once." |
