# Template prototype

Template prototype is like a master page template. Anything you configure in the prototype is applied to all page templates. The prototype makes configuration efficient as you only need to do it once. For example, add an area to the prototype to make it available on all pages. You can override the prototype at the [page definition](../../Template-definition/Page-definition/) level if needed.

**Best practice**

Put commonly used things in the template prototype. If most pages on your site have the same areas then define those areas in the prototype.

## [](#_do_i_need_a_prototype)Do I need a prototype?

No, it is not necessary to use a prototype. You can configure a separate [page definition](../../Template-definition/Page-definition/) for each page template instead. This works fine if you have a small number of templates that are very different from each other.

Prototype is an optional templating mechanism that offers a number of benefits:

-   Ensures uniformity across templates

-   Avoids repeating and duplicating configuration

-   Creates similar templates quickly


## [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

-   [Site module](../../../../../../site/). You need to install the Site module and configure a [site definition](../) in order create a prototype.


| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `areas` | **optional** Common areas such as footer or navigation that are used on most pages. Each child node is an [area definition](../../Template-definition/Area-definition/) . Define the areas in the prototype so you don’t have to repeat them in each [page definition](../../Template-definition/Page-definition/) . |
| `templateScript` | **optional** The `templateScript` property allows you to define a common page [template script](../../Template-scripts/) for the whole site. For a page to inherit its template script from the prototype you must also define `renderType=site` in the [template definition](../../Template-definition/) . A page template script typically starts with an opening `<html>` element and ends with the closing `</html>` element when rendering HTML output. ** See [main.ftl file]({repo-travelDemo}) in the Travel Demo. Example : The [Travel Demo](../../../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Demo/) defines a template script in the prototype. This common script is used for all pages. It is also the reason why no YAML page definition in the demo has an explicit `templateScript` property. The page definitions set `renderType=site` to inherit the script from the prototype, see [home.yaml]({repo-travelDemo}) for example in the travel demo repository. | ** | See [main.ftl file]({repo-travelDemo}) in the Travel Demo. |
| ** | See [main.ftl file]({repo-travelDemo}) in the Travel Demo. |
| `$type` | **required** , if the `class` property is not defined in the template definition. An alias specifying the type of the prototype. Use the following values: • `prototype` for ordinary prototypes. • `spaPrototype` for SPA-based prototypes. |
| `class` | **optional** A custom definition class that extends info.magnolia.rendering.template.configured.ConfiguredTemplateDefinition (an implementation of info.magnolia.rendering.template.TemplateDefinition ). You only need a custom class if you want to add your own nodes and properties in the prototype. Implement corresponding methods to operate on those properties in the definition class. Example : `PageTemplateDefinition` is a custom definition class used in the Travel Demo. It adds support for a `jsFiles` node, which allows you to define JavaScript files in the prototype the same way a [theme](../../Theme/) defines them. |

## [](#_merging_a_prototype_with_a_page_definition)Merging a prototype with a page definition

When a user requests a page Magnolia merges the prototype with a [page definition](../../Template-definition/Page-definition/). The result is a merged template definition which is then used to render the page.

The merged definition is virtual. You won’t find its configuration anywhere. It is created dynamically at the time of rendering. However, you can access the merged definition in a template script using the `def` [rendering context object](../../Template-scripts/Rendering-context-objects/#_def).

**Example**: Merging a prototype (configured in JCR) with a home page definition (configured in [YAML](../../../YAML/))

1.  Prototype defines the `main` [area type](../../Template-definition/Area-definition/) as `list`. Page definition adds `availableComponents` for the area. The result contains both.

2.  Prototype defines a `templateScript`. Page definition says nothing about script. The result is that the home page uses the script defined in the prototype.

3.  Prototype defines the `footer` area as not editable. Page definition overrides this decision by allowing footer editing on the home page. The result is that the footer can be edited on the home page only.
