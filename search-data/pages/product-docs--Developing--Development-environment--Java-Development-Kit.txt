# Java Development Kit

You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) for developing and deploying Magnolia. See the [certified stack](../../../Administration/Certified-stack/) for supported Java versions. Check the version of Java SE installed on the platform where you plan to develop.

> **Note:** You may already have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your machine, but you specifically need JDK for development.

To download Java SE:

1.  Go to [Java SE downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

2.  Click the JDK download link.

3.  Accept the license agreement and download a version for your platform.

4.  Start the installer and follow its instructions.
