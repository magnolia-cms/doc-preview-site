# Imaging

[Digital asset management (DAM)](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) Bundled: [Extension](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/#_module_types) Version 5.0.0 [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

The Imaging module simplifies working with images. Authors don’t need to resize and crop each image by hand as the imaging engine generates variations on the fly. Instead, administrators create the rules that determine the sizes of derivatives. Authors can then select an image from the [DAM](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) or upload one, and it’s automatically adapted to match the rule.

The Imaging module provides a comprehensive framework for programmatic image transformation. In addition to resizing and cropping through configurable operations, the module applies sophisticated filters for advanced image processing and manipulation. It also renders text overlays with customizable fonts, colors, and positioning.
