# Magnolia Audit Logs deep dive

## [](#_log_chart)Log chart

The histogram visualizes content operation events over time. Click any bar to filter logs to that specific time period.

## [](#_filters)Filters

Use these filter controls to narrow down the logs you want to view. You can filter by:

-   **Time range:** From and To dates to specify the period

-   **Infrastructure:** Cluster, namespace, pod, and container to isolate specific deployment locations

-   **Component:** Author or Public instances

-   **Operations:** Action types (create, update, delete, move, copy, etc.)

-   **Identity:** Usernames performing the operations

-   **Content location:** Workspaces, node types, source paths, and destination paths


Click the reset button to clear all active filters and return to viewing all logs.

## [](#_log_count)Log count

This displays the total number of log entries that match your currently applied filters. When logs are available, a download button appears here, allowing you to export the filtered results for further analysis.

## [](#_details_table)Details table

The table shows individual log entries with detailed information about each audit event, including timestamp, action, username, workspace, node type, source and destination paths, and infrastructure details (namespace, pod, container, component). Click any row to open a detailed drawer with complete event information.
