# Magnolia Cloud - Initial release

Released on

November 15, 2016

Magnolia is available as a cloud-based platform-as-a-service offering built on top of Magnolia CORE. It provides you with the complete infrastructure needed to run Magnolia in the cloud and enable the continuous delivery of your custom modules.

Please refer to the [supported features](../../../Supported-modules-in-the-cloud/) page for a list of Magnolia features included in Magnolia in the cloud.

The documentation explains the main functions available in the Magnolia cockpit, including how to:

-   Use the [Magnolia Cockpit](../../../Cockpit/).

-   [Develop](../../../Developing-for-Magnolia-in-the-cloud/) your own custom modules (with a step-by-step [tutorial](../../../Hello-Cloud/)).

-   [Set up your Magnolia environments](../../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/).

-   [Propagate](../../../managing-updates-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/) your development work and custom modules from a local machine, through the different integration and testing phases all the way to your live site.
