# Vector Database integration

The Vector Database integration provides semantic search and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities for Magnolia CMS. It enables AI to understand and retrieve relevant content based on meaning rather than just keywords.

The system indexes your Magnolia content (pages, assets, and structured content) as vector embeddings, enabling semantic search, context-aware AI, multi-modal search across text and metadata, permission-aware results, and multi-site and multi-language support.

The system uses an embedded architecture with PostgreSQL pgvector for vector storage. All embedding generation happens within Magnolia using the AI task framework. No external microservices required.

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **context-core** *(Magnolia module)* | Content extraction, indexing triggers, embedding generation, secure search, and REST APIs. Runs within Magnolia JVM. |
| **context-pgvector** *(Magnolia module)* | PostgreSQL pgvector integration for vector storage and similarity search. |
| **PostgreSQL + pgvector** *(Database)* | Stores embeddings and performs similarity search. Uses the pgvector extension for efficient vector operations. |

## [](#_key_features)Key features

### [](#_content_indexing)Content indexing

-   **Automatic indexing**: Content is automatically indexed when created or modified via JCR observation

-   **Manual re-indexing**: Trigger full workspace re-indexing via dashboard or REST API

-   **Configurable**: Choose which workspaces, paths, and content types to index

-   **Multi-language**: Create separate embeddings per language for multilingual sites


### [](#_search_and_retrieval)Search and retrieval

-   **Three-layer security**:

    -   Layer 1: ACL pre-filtering at query time

    -   Layer 2: JCR permission verification on results

    -   Layer 3: TF-IDF relevance reranking


-   **Workspace filtering**: Search across multiple workspaces with permission checks

-   **Metadata filtering**: Filter by language, content type, workspace, and custom metadata


### [](#_management)Management

-   **Context Dashboard**: React-based UI for monitoring indexing status, viewing sync state, and triggering re-indexing

-   **Job tracking**: Track indexing job progress with callbacks and status updates

-   **Startup validation**: Automatic validation on startup to detect data loss and trigger recovery

-   **Stale job cleanup**: Automatically clean up jobs from crashed instances
