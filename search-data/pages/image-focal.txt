# Image Focal module

[Digital asset management (DAM)](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) Unbundled: [Extension](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/#_module_types) Version 2.0.0 [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

The Magnolia Image Focal module provides advanced image management capabilities that empower content editors to control how images are displayed across different screen sizes and contexts.

This comprehensive solution consists of three specialized submodules:

-   **Focal areas** (Legacy): Define specific regions of an image to display for different screen ratios, ensuring the most important content is always visible across devices.

-   **Focal point**: Select a single point of interest on an image to guide automatic cropping and responsive display, so the key subject always remains in focus.

-   **Focal hotspot**: Create interactive hotspots on images, attach custom fields (such as titles or links), and configure dialogs for flexible, context-aware image annotations.


As part of Magnolia’s DAM (Digital Asset Management) solution, the module seamlessly integrates with existing workflows while offering flexible configuration options for custom image variations, quality settings, and rendering algorithms. Whether you need responsive images that adapt to different devices, precise focal point control for consistent cropping, or interactive hotspots for enhanced user engagement, the Image Focal module delivers the tools you need to create compelling, optimized visual experiences.
