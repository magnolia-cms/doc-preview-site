# Magnolia 6.3.16 known issues

## [](#_ui_freezes_when_working_with_a_rich_text_field_editor)UI freezes when working with a rich text field editor

In Magnolia 6.3.15 and 6.3.16, the UI freezes when working with a [rich text field](../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Rich-text-field/) editor, particularly when switching tabs or languages. This impacts common day-to-day operations for editors.

The issue has been resolved in the Magnolia 6.3.17 release. The fix is tracked in ticket [MGNLUI-9284](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9284).

We apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience while we resolve this issue.
