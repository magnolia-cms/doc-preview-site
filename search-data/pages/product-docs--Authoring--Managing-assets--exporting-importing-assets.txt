# Exporting and importing assets

You can export and import your assets in Magnolia. When you export an asset or a folder from the Assets app, Magnolia creates an XML file that includes the asset itself and all its details. To import an asset, you must also use an XML file.

> **Note:** Importing and exporting is only available for assets stored in Magnolia JCR. If your setup uses a different storage approach, then these actions are not available in the Assets app.

## [](#_exporting)Exporting

To export an asset or folder:

1.  Select an item or folder.

2.  In the Action bar, click **Export**.


> **Warning:** The exported XML file also contains asset (folder) metadata such as mgnl:activationStatus. Even if you permanently delete the asset on the author instance, when you reimport it, the asset retains its publication status even though it no longer exists on the public instance.
