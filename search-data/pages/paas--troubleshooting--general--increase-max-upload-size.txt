# Increase upload file size in forms

By default, the upload file size is `1mb`. You can increase this value using annotations in the ingress:

```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 5m
nginx.org/client-max-body-size: 5m
```

> **Note:** After making these changes in the ingress, you have to redeploy your helm chart to pick up the changes.
