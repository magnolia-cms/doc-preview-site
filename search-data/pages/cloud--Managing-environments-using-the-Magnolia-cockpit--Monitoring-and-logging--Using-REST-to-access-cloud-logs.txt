This page describes the `logs` endpoint, which can be used to access Magnolia cloud instance logs. For viewing and managing the logs via the Cockpit, see the [Managing cloud log levels](../Managing-cloud-log-levels/) page.

## [](#_obtaining_an_authentication_token)Obtaining an authentication token

> **Warning:** ImportantWhen sending REST requests, make sure you always send them via a secure protocol such as HTTPS so that communication with the endpoint is encrypted.

A REST request for a cloud log must be authenticated. Magnolia uses authentication based on the [JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token). To obtain a JWT token, issue the following `curl` command in bash, where:

-   `<your_username>` is the LDAP user name assigned to you in your Cloud subscription package to access the Cockpit.

-   `<your_password>` is the LDAP user name assigned to you in the package.

-   `<cockpit-domain-name>` is the domain name of your Cockpit.


```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Username: <your_username>" -H "X-Auth-Password: <your_password>" -X POST https://<cockpit-domain-name>/authenticate
```

For example:

```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Username: John" -H "X-Auth-Password: Doe" -X POST https://cockpit.example.com/authenticate
```

You should get a response like this:

```json
{"authToken":"<token-header>.<token-payload>.<token-signature>"}
```

The token required is this part: `<token-header>.<token-payload>.<token-signature>`.

| Parameter | Description | Parameter Type | Data Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `siteName` | **required** The code of your subscription package. You can find the site name displayed in your [environments](../../) , for example `magnolia-mkg-integration-5-6-3-public1` . The `siteName` is the prefix before the environment type, in this example, `magnolia-mkg` . | `query` | `String` |
| `environment` | **required** The environment name. Can only be one of the following: • `live` • `uat` • `integration` | `query` | `String` |
| `mgnlInstanceName` | **required** The name of the instance. You can find the instance name after setting up an environment or in the [View log page](../Managing-cloud-log-levels/) instance dropdown. For example: `author1` , `public1` , `public2` | `query` | `String` |
| `logMoveDirection` | **required** The direction in which to traverse the log. Use `1` for going forwards or `-1` for going backwards. | `query` | `Integer` |
| `recordLocator` | **optional** A specific log record that serves as the main reference point. The locator is a Base64-encoded string. ** To get a `recordLocator` , first send the request without this parameter and choose a value shown in the response. | ** | To get a `recordLocator` , first send the request without this parameter and choose a value shown in the response. | `query` | `String` |
