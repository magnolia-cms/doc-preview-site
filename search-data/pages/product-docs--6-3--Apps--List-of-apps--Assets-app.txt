# Assets app

The Assets app is a container app for asset management subapps such as the Magnolia Assets subapp, Amazon S3 Assets, or Bynder.

Magnolia Assets subapp is a Magnolia-native solution for simple Digital Asset Management (DAM) scenarios. It’s installed in the Assets app by the [\[Digital Asset Management module](../../../../../dam/) and allows you to manage media assets in Magnolia’s [digital asset management system (DAM)](../../../use-cases/Digital-asset-management/).

Alternatively, Magnolia provides out-of-the-box DAM extensions for Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Bynder. When configured, these extensions are also displayed as subapps in the Assets app. See the [External DAM integration framework](../../../Modules/extensions-and-frameworks/external-dam-integration-framework/) for information.

## [](#_usage)Usage

To open the app, click the Assets tile in the App launcher:

What’s displayed depends on what subapps are installed. For example, the screenshot below shows the Assets app with the Magnolia Assets subapp and the Bynder subapp:
