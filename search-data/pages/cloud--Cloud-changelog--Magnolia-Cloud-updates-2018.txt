# Magnolia Cloud updates 2018

This page lists the updates for Magnolia Cloud in 2018. Click on an entry to see details or .

## [](#_configuring_root_domain_redirect_rules)Configuring root domain redirect rules

You can now [configure your own root domain redirect rules](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Configuring-domain-redirect-rules/) in the cockpit.

## [](#_choose_your_own_automatic_backup_time)Choose your own automatic backup time

You can now choose a specific time for the [automatic backup of your environments](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Backing-up-and-restoring/) to be scheduled in line with your project requirements. The default automatic backup time is 01:00 UTC.

Contact the [Magnolia Cloud Support](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6/group/18) team to tell them your needs.

## [](#_magnolia_core_5_7_1_and_5_6_8)Magnolia CORE 5.7.1 and 5.6.8

With this update, you can use Magnolia CORE 5.7.1 and Magnolia CORE 5.6.8 when [setting up your environments](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Setting-up-a-new-environment/) in the cloud.

## [](#_maintenance_mode_in_cockpit)Maintenance mode in cockpit

When Magnolia is conducting a support or maintenance operation requiring downtime, we now switch your subscription package to maintenance mode. You can only view your package when it is in maintenance mode. A message indicating that your package is temporarily in maintenance mode is displayed in the [subscription package overview](../../Cockpit/#_sub_package_overview) page:

> **Tip:** The Magnolia Cloud Support team will always contact you to schedule any downtime required in advance.

## [](#_magnolia_core_5_7)Magnolia CORE 5.7

## [](#_magnolia_core_5_6_6)Magnolia CORE 5.6.6

With this update, you can use Magnolia CORE 5.6.6 when [setting up your environments](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Setting-up-a-new-environment/) in the cloud.

## [](#_content_of_integration_and_uat_environments_not_publicly_accessible)Content of Integration and UAT environments not publicly accessible

Access to content on the Integration and UAT environment public instances can now be restricted.

During the on-boarding process, Magnolia asks you for a whitelist of IP addresses for these environments to limit access to only those who need it. For example, your employees tasked with developing and testing work.

We have restricted access for security reasons and to prevent content on the Integration and UAT environment public instances being unnecessarily indexed by search robots.

## [](#_security_vulnerabilities_fixed)Security vulnerabilities fixed

We have fixed several security issues with this release. We keep details of this kind of fix private in line with our [Security Policy](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Security/Security-policy/).

[Contact our Support team](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6/group/18) if you need more information.

With this update, you can use Magnolia CORE 5.6.5 when [setting up your environments](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Setting-up-a-new-environment/) in the cloud.

## [](#_upgrading_magnolia)Upgrading Magnolia

[Upgrade your cloud environments directly from the cockpit](../../managing-updates-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Upgrading-Magnolia-in-the-cloud/) when a new version of Magnolia is released and available on the Cloud (as is the case for Magnolia CORE 5.6.5 in this update).

## [](#_logging_improvements)Logging improvements

Filter the logs you want to display in the **View logs** page by start date and time, end date and time or in a given date and time frame.

Use the **Download** button to download the logs displayed in TXT format.

**Log levels** are now working as expected from Magnolia 5.6.5 on. For more information, see [Managing cloud log levels](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Monitoring-and-logging/Managing-cloud-log-levels/).

Developers can also use the REST API `logs` endpoint to get Magnolia cloud instance logs and integrate them with external tools. For more information, see [Using REST to access cloud logs](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Monitoring-and-logging/Using-REST-to-access-cloud-logs/).

## [](#_https_url_for_git_repository)HTTPS URL for Git repository

The link to the git repository displayed in the **Additional information** section of the cockpit is now an HTTPS link to avoid issues with SSH keys.

\[For example: \[[https://<username>@gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/documentation/product-docs.git](https://<username>@gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/documentation/product-docs.git)\]([https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/documentation/product-docs](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/documentation/product-docs))\]\\{.diff-block-target diff-block-context}

## [](#_sticker_to_differentiate_environment_instances)Sticker to differentiate environment instances

From the Manage environments section, you can **View logs** for each running Public and Author instance.

For more information, see [Managing cloud log levels](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Monitoring-and-logging/Managing-cloud-log-levels/).

## [](#_response_time_and_performance_improvements)Response time and performance improvements

We have optimized how we use Apache Tomcat for Magnolia cloud to provide better performance and scalability.
