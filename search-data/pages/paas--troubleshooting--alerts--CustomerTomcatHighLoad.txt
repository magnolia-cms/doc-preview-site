## [](#_solutions)Solutions

This section provides solutions that should help resolve the issue in most cases.

### [](#_analyze_magnolia_implementation)Analyze Magnolia implementation

In general Magnolia performance issues are due to the project implementation rather than an infrastructure problem.

If the Magnolia instance is a production public instance, check the incoming requests from the CDN (*e.g., Fastly*) for suspicious activity such as a high volume of requests from one or a few IPs; this could be load testing or an ongoing DDoS attack.

Restarting Magnolia instances may clear backlogged connection requests, but it won’t necessarily fix slow request processing by Magnolia and it is likely that conditions leading to the `CustomerTomcatHighLoad` alert will continue to occur.
