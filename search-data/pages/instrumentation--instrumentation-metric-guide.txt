# Metrics guide

[Administration](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/administration/) [Tier 1](../../incubator-modules/incubator-module-list/#_tier_1_modules) [Incubator](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/incubator/instrumentation) [INSTRUMENT](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/INSTRUMENT) [Magnolia 6.4](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

The Instrumentation module and the default configuration for probes will provide a wide variety of metrics for collection with Prometheus. This guide describes each of the metrics available, their labels and their results.

Most, though not all of the probes, allow you to configure the metric name through the usual means of Magnolia configuration. However, some metrics have names that cannot be configured, particularly the [JVM probes](../probes/jvm-probes/).

The `v2.0` release of the Instrumentation module and the default instrumentation configuration module marks a major overhaul in the naming of metrics collected by the instrumentation probes.

As of `v2.0`, metric names should conform to Prometheus’s [proposed naming convention](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/). If you add your own instrumentation probes, please follow the Prometheus naming convention.

This guide describes:

-   The metric name (plus Pre-v2.0 name and v1.6 name if different)

-   The metric value

-   Metric labels

-   Source probe for the metric

-   Notes on any peculiarities or gotchas for the metric

-   Some sample Prometheus queries


| **Current name** | `mgnl_cache_total` |
| --- | --- |
| **Pre-v2.0 name** | `cache` |
| **Probe** | [CacheProbe](../probes/cache-probes/) |
| **Value** | An accumulating count of Magnolia cache operations (label: operation) per defined cache (label: cache), path (label: path) and domain. |
| **Configuration** | `/modules/cache/config/contentCaching/defaultPageCache/listeners/defaultPageCache` |

| **Current name** | `mgnl_filterChain_requests_total` |
| --- | --- |
| **Pre-v2.0 name** | `mgnl_total_requests` |
| **Probe** | [SimpleCounterFilterProbe](../probes/filter-probes/) |
| **Value** | An accumulating count of requests reaching the probe in filter chain. ** Requests must match the voters configured for the filter probe; requests that do not match will not be counted. | ** | Requests must match the voters configured for the filter probe; requests that do not match will not be counted. |
| ** | Requests must match the voters configured for the filter probe; requests that do not match will not be counted. |
| **Configuration** | `/server/filters/totalRequests` |

| **Current name** | `mgnl_renderingTime_seconds` |
| --- | --- |
| **Pre-v2.0 name** | `renderingTime` |
| **Probe** | [RenderingProbe](../probes/rendering-probes/) |
| **Value** | The time spent rendering the element (page, area or component) in seconds. |
| **Configuration** | `/server/rendering/engine/listeners/renderingProbe` |

| **Current name** | `mgnl_instance` |
| --- | --- |
| **Pre-v2.0 name** | `mgnlInstance` |
| **Probe** | [InstanceProbe](../probes/magnolia-configuration-probes/) |
| **Value** | Values: • 1.0 if a Magnolia author instance • 0.0 if a Magnolia public instance |
| **Configuration** | `/modules/instrumentation/probes/instance` |

| **Current name** | Names: • `jvm_classes_loaded` : current number classes loaded in the JVM • `jvm_classes_loaded_total` : total number of classes loaded into the JVM since starting • `jvm_classes_unloaded_total` : total number of classes unloaded from the JVM since starting |
| --- | --- |
| **Pre-v3.0.0 name** | Same as current. |
| **Probe** | [ClassLoadingProbe](../probes/jvm-probes/) |
| **Value** | • `jvm_classes_loaded` : current number of classes loaded in the JVM • `jmv_classes_unloaded_total` : total number classes unloaded from the JVM since starting • `jmv_classes_loaded_total` : total number of classes loaded into the JVM since starting |
| **Configuration** | `/modules/instrumentation/config/probes/classLoading` |
