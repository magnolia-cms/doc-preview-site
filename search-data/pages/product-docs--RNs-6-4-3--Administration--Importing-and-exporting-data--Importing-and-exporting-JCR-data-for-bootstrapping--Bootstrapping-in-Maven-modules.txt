# Bootstrapping in Maven modules

This page explains how bootstrapping works in Maven modules.

Bootstrap files are used to load content into the JCR. Bootstrap files can be shared across Magnolia instances and typically contain configuration necessary to run modules or content (such as pages, assets and others).

## [](#_how_bootstrapping_in_maven_modules_works_overview)How bootstrapping in Maven modules works - overview

Here’s an overview of how bootstrapping in Maven modules works:

1.  [Export](../#_importing_and_exporting_jcr_data_with_apps_from_the_admin_ui) JCR data files from Magnolia’s AdminCentral.

2.  The exported files are placed in the [bootstrap folder](#_using_bootstrapping_folders) of the module or webapp.

3.  On installation, the bootstrapped data is automatically\* imported by Magnolia and added to its corresponding JCR workspace.


\*) Bootstrap files can also be imported or bootstrapped manually using the import actions in the [JCR Browser](../../../../Apps/List-of-apps/JCR-Browser-app/) and many other apps. However, the content of this page is limited to automatically importing bootstrap files and the term `bootstrapping` is used in this context only.

| Location |  |
| --- | --- |
| `WEB-INF/bootstrap/author` | Files will only be imported if the current context is an **author** context. |
| `WEB-INF/bootstrap/common` | Files will be imported on any context. |

## [](#_bootstrapping_content_into_cluster_nodes)Bootstrapping content into cluster nodes

The `magnolia.repositories.jackrabbit.cluster.master` property can be used to identity an instance as a cluster master node. By default this property is set to `false` in `magnolia.properties`. When enabled Magnolia bootstraps content only into master nodes. This ensures that other (replica) nodes installed later don’t override already bootstrapped content. See [Configuration management](../../../Architecture/Configuration-management/) for more.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `magnolia.bootstrap.samples` | **optional** , *default is true* Installs sample bootstrap files located in `/mgnl-bootstrap-samples/<module name>` directory. |
| `magnolia.bootstrap.dir` | **required** , *default is `WEB-INF/bootstrap/author WEB-INF/bootstrap/common`* Sets the directory for webapp bootstrap files. |
| `magnolia.repositories.jackrabbit.cluster.master` | **required** , default is `false` Identifies an instance as cluster master node. |
