# Copying content for testing

You can copy the *[content](../../Cockpit/Magnolia-cockpit-concepts/#_glossary_content)* from one environment to another for testing purposes. The copy operation copies all editor-created content, such as pages and assets, from the Magnolia JCR [workspaces](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Workspaces/) source environment.

Content from both the author and the public instances is copied to corresponding target instances. When copying content, both the source environment (*where you’re copying from*) and target environment (*where you’re copying to*) are locked during the copying process. Once complete, the environments are unlocked again. All content in the target environment is overridden, except the `config`, `users`, `userroles` and `usergroups` workspaces, during the copy operation.

You can copy:

-   From Live to UAT or Integration.

-   From UAT to Integration.


> **Caution:** Because the Integration (INT) environment is a smaller environment by default, there is a slightly increased likelihood of a copy action failing when copying to the INT environment from Live or UAT. Typical causes are large assets that are greater than (>) 50mb in size.

> **Warning:** Although passwords are copied over, you must replace them in the target environment for them to be valid.

The copy operation does **not** copy:

-   Any administrator-created content in the `config` workspace.

-   Users, roles and groups defined in the Security app.

-   Any light modules deployed in the source environment.


Use this functionality to test a new light module or an updated light module in the Integration environment on the basis of your Live or UAT content.

You can only copy content *backward*, that is, from Live to UAT or Integration, or from UAT to Integration. To promote your changes *forward*, you must [create a release](../creating-a-release/).

1.  In **Promoted releases**, click **Manage updates**.

3.  Select the source environment from which you want to copy content and the target environment the content will be copied to before clicking **Next**.

4.  Confirm the consequences of the copy operation and click **Copy**.

    The copy operation begins.

5.  Click **OK**. As all actions in the Magnolia cockpit are asynchronous, you can click on **OK** before the copy is complete: the action will run in the background and a notification will appear once it is complete.

    > **Note:** This action appears in the activity log and a notification banner is displayed.


Once you have copied the environment’s content to another environment and made the changes or corrections you required, you can [create a release](../creating-a-release/) to wrap these changes in preparation for promoting in the [UAT](../promoting-a-release-to-UAT/) or [Live](../promoting-a-release-to-Live/) environment.

> **Note:** Release versions of the environments displayed in the Package overview are not affected by the copy operation. Check the activity log instead.
