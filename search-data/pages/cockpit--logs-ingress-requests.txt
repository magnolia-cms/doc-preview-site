# Ingress request logs

Ingress request logs provide detailed records of all HTTP/HTTPS requests routed through your Kubernetes Ingress controllers to your applications. These logs are essential for monitoring traffic flow, debugging routing issues, and understanding how requests reach your backend services.

By examining these logs, you can track which hosts and paths are being accessed, monitor SSL/TLS certificate usage, troubleshoot `404` errors or misconfigurations, and ensure your load balancing and routing rules are working as intended.
