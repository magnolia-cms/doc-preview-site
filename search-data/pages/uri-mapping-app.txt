# URI Mapping app

[Developer productivity](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/developer-productivity/) [Incubator](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/incubator/uri-mapping-app) Version [2.0.0](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/URIMAPPING) [Magnolia 6.3](../product-docs/6.3/) compatible\[[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")\]

The **URI Mapping app** module provides a content app for creating [Virtual URI mapping](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/URI-mapping/Virtual-URI-mapping/) via the user interface instead of pure configuration. It is possible to activate/deactivate and publish the mappings.

> **Warning:** Give the rights to define Uri-Mappings actions to privileged users with sufficient instructions only.Be aware that an incorrect virtual URI mapping can lock you out of your system.Be sure to understand what VirtualUriMappings are about.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.uri.mapping</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-uri-mapping-app</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## [](#_usage)Usage

The following are important points to consider:

-   It is not possible to define Uri mappings at the root level, so you must first create a folder.

-   It is not possible to edit or rename a Uri mapping while its active.

-   You can see the active state of the Uri mapping in the 'active' column.

-   To activate/deactivate the Uri mapping, use the corresponding Action from the Actionbar.


> **Important:** If you publish an active Uri mapping to the public instance, the mapping is automatically activated on that instance.When creating a mapping in the app, the mappings node is not required for the HostBasedVirtualUriMapping because the app resolves it internally, eliminating the need for an explicit mappings node.
