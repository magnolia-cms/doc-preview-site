## [](#_synchronize)Synchronize

Synchronize Ingresses with the Cockpit. This means that any unpublished changes are lost. Synchronization updates the Cockpit’s view of an unclaimed Ingress to reflect its current configuration in the Kubernetes cluster. Use the synchronize button sparingly to align states.

Synchronization is not available for claimed Ingresses.

## [](#_name)Name

The name of the ingress including the description. You can enter a description when creating an ingress. The default description is "Imported from existing ingress".

## [](#_origin)Origin

Where the ingress was created.

-   `COCKPIT`: created in the Cockpit. (preferred)

-   `MANUAL`: created in Rancher.

-   `PIPELINE`: created as part of your *infra-as-code* setup.


## [](#_status_2)Status

The status of the certificate.

-   **Created**: New ingress; unpublished.

-   **Modified**: Changes were made to the ingress; unpublished.

-   **Deleted**: The ingress is marked for deletion; it is removed the next time you publish (sync).

-   **Synced**: Published ingress including any changes (if applicable).


## [](#_rules)Rules

Any rules you have defined. Ingress rules specify the direction of allowed access to and from different identities and resources.

Each host routes to a destination.

-   **FASTLY**: When the domain is behind Fastly CDN.

-   **CLUSTER**: When the domain routes to the cluster load balancer IPs.

-   **OTHER**: When the domain routes to unknown IPs or CNAME (private CDN, WAF, …​).

-   **UNAVAILABLE**: Private domains, no public information available.
