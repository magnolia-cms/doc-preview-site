Magnolia provides a standard [Mail Module](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Mail-module/) that allows you to send emails from within Magnolia CMS. This is configured directly within your Magnolia instance. For Magnolia Cloud, the option to use the [AWS Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) (SES) is also available. This is a scalable option based on your needs and additional costs may apply. Here, we outline the steps you need to take to request this service.

AWS SES Email is only available for the Live environment.

## [](#_request_the_ses_email_option)Request the SES Email option

1.  First, send a request to the [Magnolia Cloud Helpdesk](https://mgnl.io/cloud-helpdesk) stating that you would like to use the SES Email option.

    > **Note:** Allow a minimum of two weeks from the time you want this service.

2.  After receiving assistance from the helpdesk, you may need to add entries to your DNS as AWS SES must validate your domain.
