# Magnolia front-end development

With Magnolia *front-end development* we are referring to the most common task on most web projects: developing templates to generate the actual HTML, CSS and JS of the projects - and enabling authors to populate them with content.

Many [Magnolia projects](../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Magnolia-project-overview/) involve both front-end and back-end developers. To help you all work together in parallel, Magnolia supports both java-based modules and light modules in a single project.

A light module is just a directory of files. By relying only on simple files, the Magnolia light development approach mirrors front-end development. Front-end developers can get started right away using the tools and methodologies they already know. While back-end Java developers work on integrations and custom business logic, front-end development teams can work on templates, web resources and javascript frameworks. Front-end developers are not dependent on Java developers to integrate their work and teams can work efficiently in parallel.

-   The [Get started](#_get_started) section below provides a simple introduction to working with Magnolia specifically as a front-end developer, from concepts to a little hands-on learning.

-   The [Go further](#_go_further) section provides some links to access in-depth information on the different subjects introduced.
