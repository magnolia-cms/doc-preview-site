# Managing assets

## [](#_browsing_assets)Browsing assets

By default, you browse the Magnolia DAM in tree view, which shows your assets in a hierarchical tree, including the folder structure.

> **Tip:** Your Magnolia administrator can enable other views:List view - Displays the items individually.This is the view you see when you search or filter assets.Thumbnail view - Displays thumbnail images of the assets. There is a zoom control at the top for resizing.

## [](#_how_to_handle_many_assets)How to handle many assets

The DAM can handle a very large number of assets and is used in installations with hundreds of thousands or even millions of files. To keep both JCR operations and the Assets app UI fast and usable, avoid very flat hierarchies and organize assets into folders, aiming for roughly 500 assets per folder and using subfolders where needed.

When your total volume of assets or the size of individual binaries starts to impact publication times, storage footprint, or operational workflows, consider offloading binaries to [DAM 5.0](#5.0@dam:ROOT:index.adoc), our [External DAM integration framework](../../Modules/extensions-and-frameworks/external-dam-integration-framework/), our [DAM API](../../Developing/API/Java-Server-APIs/DAM-API/), or one of our [Incubator modules](../../../../incubator-modules/) extensions.

How many assets should I put in a folder?

As a rule of thumb when using JCR for assets, you should keep it to about **500** assets per folder. This is independent of the asset type. So, whether it’s an image, pdf, or some other type of asset, let’s try to keep it under **500**.

-   Avoid storing too many assets in the same folder. Instead, create subfolders and organize your assets. Storing too many assets within the same folder may lead to performance issues.

-   If you need a large and unstructured flat list of assets, disable the thumbnail and list views.
