# Users

Manage Cockpit users for your DX Cloud subscription. This includes the ability to download users to a CSV file.

From the actions menu, you can edit user details, delete users, or reset credentials.

If you’re using SSO for your DX Cloud subscription, you cannot reset passwords for users who log in via Single Sign-On, as the password is managed by the OIDC provider.
