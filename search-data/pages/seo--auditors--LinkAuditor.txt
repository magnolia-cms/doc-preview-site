# LinkAuditor

[Deprecated](../../../incubator-modules/deprecations/)

The info.magnolia.services.seo.audit.impl.LinkAuditor will find links in a rendered HTML page and check if they are accessible. The URLs contained in HTML anchor, link and, IMG elements are extracted and checked. Other URLs, such as URLs contained in JavaScript functions won’t be detected and so won’t be checked.

> **Warning:** Checking a large number of links can be time consuming, you may want to use the excludedLinks property to ignore some links or run the auditor only when necessary.
