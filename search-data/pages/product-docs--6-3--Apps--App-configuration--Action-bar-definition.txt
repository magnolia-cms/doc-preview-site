# Action bar definition

An action bar organizes actions into sections and groups. The bar is typically displayed on the right hand side of an app. In content apps, the browser subapp has an action bar that allows the user to manage content items (add, edit or delete).

The action bar also defines [availability](#_action_bar_availability) rules that determine which section of the action bar is displayed to the user. For example, when the user selects a content item, you want to only display actions that are relevant for that item.

The action bar references actions that are [defined elsewhere](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/App-configuration/Action-definition/). This separation allows you to define an action once and use it in many places, not only in the action bar.

```yml

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `actionbar` | **required** Action bar configuration. |
| `sections` | **required** Sections defined in the bar. |
| `<section name>` | **required** Name of the section. Name your sections after what the user has selected, such as `folder` when a folder is selected. |
| `groups` | **required** Actions that belong together. Separated by horizontal lines in the action bar. |
| `<group name>` | **required** Name of the group. |
| `items` | **required** Node containing the action names. |
| `<action name>` | **required** Name of the action. Must be the same as the name defined in [Dialog definition](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/) . |
| `availability` | **optional** Defines whether the section is displayed to the user. Typically depends on what type of node the user has selected. |
| `label` | **optional** Green text displayed to users in the action bar. |
| `defaultAction` | **optional** Name of the action executed when the user double-clicks an item. |

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<section name>` | **required** Name of the section. |
| `availability` | **required** Defines the availability configuration for the section. |
| `access` | **optional** Section is available if the current user has one of the listed roles. |
| `roles` | **required** Section is available to users assigned the list of [roles](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/IAM/Roles-and-access-control-lists/) . |
| `<role>` | **required** Name of the [role](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/IAM/Roles-and-access-control-lists/) that is permitted to execute the action. Add one property for each role. |
| `nodes` | **optional** , *default is true* Section is available if the selected item is a node. |
| `nodeTypes` | **optional** Section is available if the selected item is one of the node types listed. |
| `<node type>` | **required** Valid [node type](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) such as `mgnl:folder` . |
| `rules` | **optional** Section is available if the selected item matches every availability rule class. |
| `<rule name>` | **required** It gives the node a name that describes the rule class. One node for each rule, and the node name is arbitrary. |
| `class` | **required** (unless `$type` is used) [Action availability definition class](#_action_availability_definition_classes) . The class must implement the info.magnolia.ui.api.availability.AvailabilityDefinition interface. Set the value to the fully qualified class name. |
| `$type` | You can use this as a shortcut for `class` if the definition class is annotated with info.magnolia.ui.api.availability.AvailabilityRuleType . The proper value is defined by the annotation. |
| `implementationClass` | **required** The class that contains custom logic to check if the action is permitted on the selected item and implements info.magnolia.ui.availability.rule.AvailabilityRule . Your custom class must extend info.magnolia.ui.availability.rule.AbstractAvailabilityRule . A default implementation class is typically hard-coded in the definition class. You only need to add this property if you want to override the default implementation. |
| `root` | **optional** Section is available at the workspace root level if `true` . |
| `folder` | **optional** , *default is null* Action is available for folders only if `true` , and for non-folder content only if `false` . When this property is not specified, the action is available for both folders and non-folder content. ** This option is for CDS content and is not supported for JCR content. Please see the [nodeTypes](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) option and use `mgnl:folder` node type to specify availability for folders in JCR. | ** | This option is for CDS content and is not supported for JCR content. Please see the [nodeTypes](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) option and use `mgnl:folder` node type to specify availability for folders in JCR. |
| ** | This option is for CDS content and is not supported for JCR content. Please see the [nodeTypes](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) option and use `mgnl:folder` node type to specify availability for folders in JCR. |

## [](#_action_bar_structure)Action bar structure

The structure of the action bar differs from app to app.

Here’s an example of the action bar in the Contacts app.

-   No contact selected

-   Contact selected

-   Contact deleted


With no contact selected.

When a contact is selected.

After a contact is deleted.

## [](#_restricting_actions)Restricting actions

As an administrator, you can control which actions are available to other users. For instance, you might want only the `superuser` role to have the ability to import content into the Pages app. By modifying an action’s [availability property](#_availability_properties), you can restrict whether an action is shown in the user interface.

### [](#_restrict_the_import_action_in_the_pages_app)Restrict the import action in the Pages app

To restrict which users see the import action in the Pages app, you can limit the `access` property to certain roles. You can apply the restriction by decorating the import action’s definition in the `pages-app.yaml` configuration file.

/pages-app/apps/pages-app.yaml

```yaml
subApps:
  browser:
    actions:
      import:
        availability:
          access:
            roles:
              role: superuser (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Restricts the import action’s visibility to users with the `superuser` role. |
