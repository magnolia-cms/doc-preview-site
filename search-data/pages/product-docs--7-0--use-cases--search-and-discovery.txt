# Search and discovery

![useCase search](../../_images/features/useCase-search.jpg)

For administrators, Magnolia provides a transparent, preconfigured search indexing configuration where you define what content is indexed and how it is weighted. By default Magnolia search functionality is provided by Apache’s Jackrabbit search.

> **Tip:** For high asset volumes (100,000+ DAM assets) and advanced search requirements, you can configure Magnolia to use Apache Solr instead.

The [Magnolia Travel Demo](../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Demo/) includes a complete search example, including how to search for content that is stored in a [content app](../../Apps/Developing-an-app/My-first-content-app/). For front-end developers, Magnolia provides [search templating functions](../../Developing/Templating/Template-scripts/Templating-functions/searchfn/) to render search results using only a template script.

## [](#_search_and_discovery_modules)Search and discovery modules

Magnolia modules are shipped to you in different ways depending on your license:

-   **Community Edition (CE)**: Modules are included as part of the free and open-source version.

-   **DX Core**: Modules are included as part of the DX Core enterprise product. These modules are in addition to those in the Community Edition license where bundled.

-   **Special**: Some modules need their own special license as they are not included with CE or DX Core licenses. In some cases, an additional license is required.

    > **Tip:** For more details, see License.
