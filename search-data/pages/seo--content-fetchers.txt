# Content fetchers

[Deprecated](../../incubator-modules/deprecations/)

> **Note:** Added in v5.6.2.

Some auditors check on rendered content rather than the content node itself. These auditors need some way to get the content before checking it and use a "content fetcher" to retrieve the content for them.

These auditors use content fetchers:

-   [HtmlElementAuditor](../auditors/HtmlElementAuditor/) - to check rendered HTML elements

-   [LinkAuditor](../auditors/LinkAuditor/) - to check rendered links

-   [ParagraphLengthAuditor](../auditors/ParagraphLengthAuditor/) - to check rendered text

-   [ValidHtmlAuditor](../auditors/ValidHtmlAuditor/) - to check the HTML of a rendered page


Each of these auditors must have a content fetcher configured to carry out its checks.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `requestTemplate` | **optional** The template for the preview request. The template should have a placeholder `"{0}"` for the path of the selected content node being rendered. If you set your own request template, the content node path substituted will always start with a "/". You don’t need to add a "/" to separate the host name and port from the node path in your request template. The default value of `requestTemplate` is: `http://localhost:8080{0}?mgnlPreview=true&mgnlChannel=desktop` ** The default `requestTemplate` will send its preview request to the local Magnolia instance listening on port 8080. Also, the query string of the request template specifies that it is a preview request ( `"mgnlPreview=true"` ) and to render the page as if being viewed in a desktop browser ( `"mgnlChannel=desktop"` ). You could also use the personalization preview parameters in the query string of the request template to preview the page as a given persona: `http://localhost:8080{0}?previewPersona=<persona name>&mgnlPreviewAsVisitor=true` | ** | The default `requestTemplate` will send its preview request to the local Magnolia instance listening on port 8080. |
| ** | The default `requestTemplate` will send its preview request to the local Magnolia instance listening on port 8080. |
| `targets` | **optional** Defines a list of credentials (host, port, user name and password) when requesting rendered content. The credentials will be added to the preview request and will be available as preemptive basic authentication. ** Accessing pages on the standard Magnolia author instance require authentication. You should configure credentials for accessing your local Magnolia author instance. | ** | Accessing pages on the standard Magnolia author instance require authentication.

## [](#_renderingfetcher)RenderingFetcher

Class

`info.magnolia.services.seo.audit.impl.RenderingFetcher`

`RenderingFetcher` renders content by directly invoking the Magnolia rendering engine and capturing the results.

Since `RenderingFetcher` does not send a request to Magnolia. It may be slightly faster than `RequestFetcher` but may not correctly render the content when using personalization or sites.

`RenderingFetcher` has no configuration properties.

### [](#_example_2)Example

Here is an example `RenderingFetcher` configuration:

```yaml
fetcher:
  class: info.magnolia.services.seo.audit.impl.RenderingFetcher
```
