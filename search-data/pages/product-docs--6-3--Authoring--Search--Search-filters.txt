# Filtering

Use multiple parallel filters to quickly find content or narrow down your search results.

You can filter both full-text Find bar search results across apps, and in-app search results.

> **Tip:** The total number of search results is displayed at the bottom of the page so you can see how effective your search is and decide if you want to filter results further.

-   Find bar filters

-   In-app filters


The following default search result filters are available for Find bar:

-   **Type** - All types of content configured as searchable. By default, all content apps.

-   **Tags** - All the tags applied to your content in Magnolia.

-   **Last editor**

-   **Last edited** date


If you start searching when you have an app open, Magnolia automatically filters results based on the current app so you get relevant results straight away.

Different content filters are available depending on the app you’re using. Generally, there is an in-app **Search** field and a number of drop-down filters.

For example, in the Assets app, the dropdowns are:

-   **Asset type**

-   **Author**

    Includes a **Current user** option to only display your own content. For SSO-based users, this is the only option available.

-   **Size**

-   **Status**

-   **Tag**


> **Tip:** The filters available and their options can be configured by your Magnolia administrator. Filters for external data sources can also be configured.
