# Apache Tomcat

Included in the Magnolia bundle, Apache Tomcat application server provides an environment where the Magnolia application is executed.

To install Tomcat:

1.  Go to [Apache Tomcat](http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/) and download Tomcat.
    We recommend you use the latest version of Tomcat 9 and a supported Java version. See [Certified stack](../../../Administration/Certified-stack/) too.

2.  Extract the ZIP file in the directory where you want to install Tomcat. These instructions assume you chose `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation` and installed Tomcat version 9.0.8. The subdirectory apache-tomcat-9.0.8 is created from the archive.


To verify installation:

1.  Open Command Prompt.

2.  Go to the Tomcat installation directory.
    `cd C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-tomcat-9.0.8`

3.  Start Tomcat.
    `bin\startup.bat`
    A second command prompt window is displayed for Tomcat. The following lines appear when the server has started:

    ```xml
    org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol start
    INFO: Starting Coyote HTTP/1.1 on http-8080
    org.apache.jk.common.ChannelSocket init
    INFO: JK: ajp13 listening on /0.0.0.0:8009
    org.apache.jk.server.JkMain start
    INFO: Jk running ID=0 time=0/66 config=null
    org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina start
    INFO: Server startup in 2238 ms
    ```

4.  Open a browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The message \`\`If you’re seeing this page via web browser, it means you’ve setup Tomcat successfully.'' indicates success.

5.  Type `bin\shutdown.bat` in the first command prompt window to stop Tomcat.
