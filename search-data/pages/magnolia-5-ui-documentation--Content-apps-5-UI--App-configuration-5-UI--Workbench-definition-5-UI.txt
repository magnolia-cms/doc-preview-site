## [](#_workbench_definition)Workbench definition

Here is an example workbench definition from the [Contacts app](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Apps/List-of-apps/Contacts-app.adoc). This workbench operates on the `contacts` workspace and displays contacts and folders.

```yaml
workbench:
  dropConstraintClass: info.magnolia.ui.workbench.tree.drop.AlwaysTrueDropConstraint
  editable: false
  contentViews:
  contentTools:
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `contentViews` | **required**<br><br>Defines how users can view content in the workbench. The parent node for the specific content view definitions. It must contain at least one content view, see [Content view definition](../Content-view-definition-5-UI/). |
| `dragAndDrop` | **optional**, *default is `true`*<br><br>Set to `false` to disable drag and drop operations in the workbench. |
| `dropConstraintClass` | **optional**, *default is `AlwaysTrueDropConstraint`*<br><br>A drag-and-drop constraint class. By restricting the nodes that a user can move you can enforce a certain node hierarchy. For example, you might want to allow content to be moved under folders but not folders under content. If the class is not defined, the `AlwaysTrueDropConstraint` is set as default. When you write your own class, implement the `DropConstraint` interface. |
| `editable` | **optional**<br><br>Makes the workbench editable inline. You can double-click a cell to edit its value. Works only for [columns](../Column-definition-5-UI/) which are also configured as editable.<br><br>Inline editing is available only in the tree view, not in list, thumbnail or search views.<br><br>Definining a [default action](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Apps/App-configuration/Action-bar-definition.adoc) will override inline editing. Double-clicking the cell with trigger the default action instead of inline edit mode. |
| `contentTools` | **optional**<br><br>A list of configured content tools. A content tool must be configured using `ContentToolDefinition`.<br><br>`WorkbenchPresenter` is implemented in a way that it automatically configures a search box if you have both list and search view defined. |
