# Checkout endpoint v2

This page describes the `checkout` endpoint, which can be used to interact with your external e-commerce solution’s REST checkout service.

In v2, all the rest-call paths have been slightly changed to be more descriptive and intuitive. The v2 checkout endpoint sets the address of a `cartId` to ensure the correct resource is consistently identified. For example, the v1 `/checkouts/address/{cartId}` becomes in v2 `/carts/{cartId}/address`.

In general, the checkout process involves four steps:

1.  Set an address.

2.  Get shipping methods.

3.  Set a shipping method.

4.  Create an order.


Note that in Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento), steps 1 and 2 are combined in step 2. Get shipping methods, where you must provide the `address` object as a required parameter.

> **Note:** Magento is now Adobe Commerce, powered by Magento. In the examples and configuration below, we may refer to Adobe Commerce as Magento.
