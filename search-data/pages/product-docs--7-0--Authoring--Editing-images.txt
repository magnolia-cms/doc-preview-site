# Editing images

The DAM provides basic image editing functionality. It’s not intended to replace media tools that feature advanced editing functionality.

You can edit all uploaded images in the image editor.

> **Note:** Do not edit or replace assets on Public instances when S3 storage is used. If you update an asset on Public, the asset may break and cannot be recovered. Always make changes on the Author instance and publish them to Public.

## [](#_image_editor)Image editor

To open the image editor:

1.  Select an image.

2.  Click **Edit asset** in the action bar.

3.  Click the ![Edit image icon](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-1-editImageIcon.gif) icon in the **Media** field.

4.  The image editor opens in the same tab.


> **Warning:** If you edit an image immediately after uploading it, Magnolia saves the changes directly to that image in the DAM. This action overwrites the original uploaded version, meaning you can’t go back to the unedited image without re-uploading it. To keep the original uploaded version, save it right after uploading. Then, create a duplicate of the image and perform your edits on that copy.

The image editor displays:

-   **Image** in full size. If the image is larger than the available screen, scroll bars appear to the right and below the image.

-   **Editing** actions. Edits are executed sequentially (for example, you can crop, rotate and then crop again).

    -   **Crop**: enters the crop mode. The button names change dynamically to **Crop image** and **Cancel** (WARNING: not supported in Internet Explorer 11).

    -   **Rotate**: rotates the image 90° to the right with each click.

    -   **Flip**: flips the image either horizontally or vertically.

    -   **Undo/Redo**: reverts to the state before the last edit action or re-executes the last edit action.


-   **Zoom** the image to fit the window or the actual image size. Once the image is scaled to fit, you can continue to resize your browser and the image continues to adapt dynamically.

-   **Image size** (in pixels) below the image.

-   **Cancel editing** and **Save changes**. Both actions close the editor and return you to the Asset dialog.


> **Tip:** Edit several images in parallel by opening the image editor in multiple browser tabs. This is useful when making the same edits to many images (for example, cropping to the same size or flipping).

## [](#_editing_images_in_other_apps)Editing images in other apps

You can edit images directly in other apps that use them. The procedure and actions are identical to those in the Assets app and function in exactly the same way.
