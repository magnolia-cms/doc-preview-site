# Authoring content

The first step to authoring content is to create your first page in the **Pages** app. It’s the first app in the **Favorite apps** section after you log in.

To add and edit a page:

1.  Open the Pages app.

2.  Click **Add page** in the action bar to create a new page.

3.  Give your page a name and choose one of the templates.

    > **Note:** You can edit Page properties at this point or Save changes and do it at a later point by clicking Edit page properties in the action bar.

4.  Click **Edit page** in the action bar, or double-click your new page, to edit the page content.

5.  Select the **Main** area on the page and click **Add component** in the action bar, or click the **+** plus sign in the area you want to add the content. Select the type of component and where you want it to appear.

    > **Note:** After clicking the Add component action, the list of components in the dialog is disabled if there are no other components to select. In this case, you’d add only the default one presented in the dialog.

6.  Preview your page by clicking **Preview page**.
