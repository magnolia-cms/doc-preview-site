# Create a live copy

## [](#_adding_pages)Adding pages

Newly created pages in the master aren’t automatically added to a live copy upon pushing master changes.

If you have added a new page to a master site, you must create a live copy of the new page so that its equivalent exists in the live copy site before you can push master changes to it.

If several live copies of a master exist, when you create a live copy of the subpage(s), you can choose where to locate the new subpage live copy. The live copy or copies are created in each location specified.
