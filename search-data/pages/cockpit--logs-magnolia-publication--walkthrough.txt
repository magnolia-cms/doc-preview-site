# Magnolia Publication Logs deep dive

## [](#_log_chart)Log chart

The histogram visualizes publishing activity over time, showing the distribution of successful and failed publication operations. Click any bar to filter logs to that specific time period.

## [](#_filters)Filters

Use these filter controls to narrow down the publication logs you want to view. You can filter by:

-   **Time range:** Date range picker to specify the period

-   **Infrastructure:** Namespace and pod to isolate specific deployment locations

-   **Component:** Author or Public instances

-   **Content location:** Workspace and path of the published content

-   **User:** Username of the person who initiated the publish action

-   **Subscriber:** Target public instance receiver

-   **Message content:** Free-text search to find logs containing specific keywords or error messages

-   **Performance thresholds:** Publishing size, publishing time, and subscriber response time

-   **Operation type:** Whether the action was an unpublish (deactivation) operation

-   **Transaction status:** Filter by success, committed, or rolled back status


Click the reset button to clear all active filters and return to viewing all logs.

## [](#_log_count)Log count

This displays the total number of publication log entries that match your currently applied filters. When logs are available, a download button appears here, allowing you to export the filtered results for further analysis.

## [](#_details_table)Details table

The table shows individual publication events with detailed information about each operation, including timestamp, namespace, pod, component (author or public instance), workspace, content path, username, and target subscriber.

Performance metrics show publishing size (in bytes), publishing time, and subscriber response time (both in milliseconds). Status columns indicate whether the operation was an unpublish action and the transaction outcome: success, committed, or rolled back.

Click any row to open a detailed drawer with the complete publication event information.
