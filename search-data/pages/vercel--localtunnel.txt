# LocalTunnel

## [](#_understand_the_env_file)Understand the `.env` File

In your Next.js project, the `.env` file holds crucial environment variables. A key variable is `NEXT_PUBLIC_MGNL_HOST`, which points to your Magnolia CMS instance, ensuring your Next.js application can communicate with Magnolia.

## [](#_set_next_public_mgnl_host)Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MGNL_HOST`

-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_MGNL_HOST` should be set to the URL of your accessible Magnolia instance.

-   For local development, typically use `[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)`.

-   For the Vercel deployment, we will need to use a public URL for your Magnolia instance.


## [](#_expose_your_localhost_with_localtunnel)Expose Your Localhost with LocalTunnel

Since you want to deploy to the cloud but your Magnolia instance is running on localhost, you need a way to expose your localhost to the internet. **LocalTunnel** is a tool that enables you to do this easily.

1.  Go to [LocalTunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/).

2.  Install LocalTunnel.

    ```shell
    npm install -g localtunnel
    ```

3.  Ensure your Magnolia instance is running, typically at `[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)`.

4.  Run the following in your terminal to expose `localhost` to LocalTunnel.

    ```shell
    lt --port 8080 (1)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Where `8080` is your desired port. |

    LocalTunnel will provide a URL, which will be your localhost Magnolia instance accessible from anywhere. We will call this your LocalTunnel URL. Go to the LocalTunnel URL in your browser to complete the final steps.

5.  Complete the process by following the instructions on the LocalTunnel’s website or read the [section](#LocalTunnel Instructions) below.

Access your Magnolia instance on the public domain by obtaining your local IP address.

1.  Go to [https://ipv4.icanhazip.com](https://ipv4.icanhazip.com) to display your public `IPv4` address.

2.  Copy the displayed IP address for the next step.

3.  Return to your LocalTunnel URL page.

4.  In the `"Endpoint IP:"` field, paste your copied IP address.

    > **Note:** You’ll be redirected to your Magnolia instance on the public domain. It will be something like https://chilly-zoos-rule.loca.lt this will be used in the next section by replacing the YOUR_LOCAL_TUNNEL_URL value assigned to the NEXT_PUBLIC_MGNL_HOST.
