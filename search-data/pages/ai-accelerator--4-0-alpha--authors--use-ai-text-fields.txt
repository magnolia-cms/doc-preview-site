# Use AI-powered text fields

**Available from version `1.0.5`**

You can generate text in a `textField` based on a self-defined translatable prompt which you can enrich with variable content from the dialog properties. Generate text automatically in a text field based on a developer-defined prompt, which can include dynamic variables from the dialog’s properties. AI-powered text fields are designed to create tailored content (e.g., descriptions) with minimal user input, streamlining content creation.

Recap
