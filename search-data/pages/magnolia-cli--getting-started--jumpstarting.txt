# Jumpstarting a project

The [Jumpstart plugin](../../plugins/available-plugins/jumpstart-plugin/) allows you to download a project based on a template defined in the [projectTemplates.json](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/magnolia-cli/plugins/cli-project-templates/-/blob/main/projectTemplates.json) file.

The following project templates are available:

-   Standard webapps

-   Demo webapps

-   Webapps with headless project examples


Each template contains a ready-to-use Magnolia Tomcat bundle.

## [](#_nexus_token_credentials)Nexus token credentials

Magnolia webapps installed by the Jumpstart plugin are downloaded from [nexus.magnolia-cms.com](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com).

For those that require a license, you must supply your *Nexus token* credentials instead of your SSO credentials.

The Jumpstart plugin will notify you about this with the following warning message before a prompt for the credentials appears:

```console
warn: To download from Nexus, please use your "user token name code" as the username and your "user token pass code" as the password, instead of your SSO login credentials
For more details, visit: https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/magnolia-cli/getting-started/jumpstarting/#_nexus_token_credentials
? Username
```

To obtain the token credentials:

1.  Log into [Nexus](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/) with your SSO credentials.

2.  In the top right corner, go to your profile settings.

3.  Select **User Token** in the menu on the left side.

4.  On the User Token page, click the **Access User Token** button.

    (You may now be prompted to log in again.)

5.  Your token name and pass codes are displayed.


Then, when the Jumpstart plugin prompts you for the credentials:

-   Use your **user token name code** from Nexus as the username.

-   Use your **user token pass code** from Nexus as the password.

1.  Execute the [Jumpstart plugin](../../plugins/available-plugins/jumpstart-plugin/) with this command:

    ```console
    npx @magnolia/cli@latest jumpstart [name]
    ```

    > **Caution:** The project is created in the current working directory when no [name] is provided. When a [name] is specified, the project is created in a directory with that name.

2.  Choose the webapp type you need to create:

    ```console
    1) standard-webapps (1)
    2) demo-webapps (2)
    3) headless (3)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Creates an empty webapp. This is a good starting point for any new project. |
    | **2** | Creates a webapp similar to the [Magnolia Travel Demo](../../../product-docs/6.3/Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Demo/). |
    | **3** | Creates a headless webapp such as the [Magnolia Headless Demo](../../../product-docs/6.3/Developing/headless/getting-started-with-Magnolia-headless/). |

3.  Let’s suppose you’ve selected `demo-webapps`. In the next dialog, choose a template.

    ```console
    1) magnolia-community-demo-webapp
    2) magnolia-dx-core-demo-webapp (1)
    ```

    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Requires a license. You can [contact us for a trial license](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/get-started/developer-trial.html). |

    The plugin then downloads all the necessary files for you.

    > **Note:** If you’re jumpstarting a project that requires a license, you must supply a username and a password:...

    > ? Password [hidden]You can use either your Magnolia LDAP credentials, or a token name and a token pass code provided by the Nexus interface.

    > **Tip:** You can customize the templates list by creating your own project templates file.

4.  All projects from the default [project templates](projectTemplates/) contain the [Start plugin](../../plugins/available-plugins/start-plugin/). Therefore, you can run the webapp with the following command:

    ```console
    npm run mgnl -- start
    ```

    > **Caution:** Windows users using PowerShell must enclose the two consecutive hyphens (--) in quotes:npm run mgnl "--" ...
