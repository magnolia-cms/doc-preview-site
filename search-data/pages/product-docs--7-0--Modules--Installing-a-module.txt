# Installing a module

Back up your system before installing a module. Uninstalling a module is not always as simple as removing the file. Modules can add and change configuration in the repository. They may also change content. You should try the module in a test environment first. A module is responsible for updating itself across versions. Keep only one version of each module and its dependencies.

## [](#_folders_and_zip_files)Folders and ZIP files

Choose this option if the module is delivered as a folder or a ZIP file. This type of module is configured completely on the file system.

1.  Copy the folder or extract the ZIP into the `magnolia.resources.dir` directory.

2.  Magnolia scans the directory periodically and registers the module. It also detects new and modified templates, dialogs and resources.


## [](#_what_is_magnolia_resources_dir)What is `magnolia.resources.dir`?

`magnolia.resources.dir` is a property defining the directory from which [resources](../../Developing/Resources/) are loaded in a Magnolia instance. This directory is used for file-based resources such as light modules and for overriding classpath resources. The property is configured in `WEB-INF/config/default/magnolia.properties` and its default value is `$magnolia.home/modules`. To see the current value of the property, go to the Config Info tab in the [About Magnolia app](../../Apps/List-of-apps/About-Magnolia-app/).

> **Note:** You can use symbolic links (symlinks or soft links) in the resources directory to include light modules located elsewhere on your system.

Set the `magnolia.resources.filesystem.observation.excludedDirectories` property to exclude directories from being observed for changes. (See the table in the [Configuration management: Defining properties](../../Administration/Architecture/Configuration-management/#_defining_properties) section.)

## [](#_jar_files)JAR files

Choose this option if the module is delivered as a JAR file. All modules provided by Magnolia are JAR files.

1.  Stop Magnolia.

2.  Copy the JAR files into the `WEB-INF/lib` directory.

    -   Tomcat: `/webapps/<contextPath>/WEB-INF/lib`

    -   JBoss: `/server/default/deploy/<contextPath>/WEB-INF/lib`


3.  Start Magnolia.

4.  Open a browser and go to Magnolia AdminCentral

5.  Run the Web update.


## [](#_maven_dependencies)Maven dependencies

Choose this option if you have your own [bundle](../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/Creating-a-custom-webapp-with-Maven/). Using Maven to manage module dependencies is a best practice.

1.  Add a `dependency` element including the module version number in your bundle’s parent POM:

    Bundle parent pom.xml

    ```xml
    <project>
      <dependencyManagement>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId><!-- groupId --></groupId>
            <artifactId><!-- artifactId --></artifactId>
            <version><!-- version --></version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </dependencyManagement>
    </project>
    ```

2.  Add a `dependency` element without the version number in the Magnolia webapp POM, typically inside the parent project:

    Webapp pom.xml

    ```xml
    <project>
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId><!-- groupId --></groupId>
          <artifactId><!-- artifactId --></artifactId>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
    </project>
    ```
