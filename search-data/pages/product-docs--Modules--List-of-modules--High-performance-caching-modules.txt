Magnolia does not cache [personalized](../../../use-cases/Personalization/) content by default (CE), but you can cache it with the high performance caching modules in DX Core. These modules let you cache page variants and fragments of pages. You can configure which parts of a page are cached. Use high performance caching when your site has a lot of dynamic and personalized content.

-   [Advanced Cache for Personalization](Advanced-Cache-for-Personalization/)

-   [SiteMesh module](SiteMesh-module/)
