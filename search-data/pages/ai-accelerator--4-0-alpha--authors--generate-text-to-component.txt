# Generate components from text

Available as a preview in version `3.1.0`

This feature is currently provided as a preview and will be further improved based on feedback from real-world usage. Please share your experience and improvement points on [feedback@magnolia-cms.com](mailto:feedback@magnolia-cms.com).

Transform plain text into fully populated page components with the AI Accelerator module. This feature eliminates the need to manually fill out dialog fields by allowing you to provide a free-form text description. The AI interprets the text and automatically populates all component fields, accelerating content creation.

## [](#_usage)Usage

Create components by providing natural language descriptions:

1.  Open the Pages app.

2.  Open a page and select the area to which you want to add a component.

3.  Click **Text to component** in the action bar.

4.  Click **Component** and select the type of component you want to add.

    Depending on the type of component you select, additional input buttons appear (such as **Images** or **References**).

5.  Enter or paste your content in plain text format.

6.  Click **Generate** to let the AI interpret your text and create the component.

    The AI analyzes your text, determines the appropriate component structure, and automatically fills all dialog fields with the extracted information.
