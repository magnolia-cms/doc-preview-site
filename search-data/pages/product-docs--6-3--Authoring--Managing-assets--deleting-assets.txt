# Deleting an asset

[Versioning](../../Versioning/) is enabled in the DAM. This allows you to restore previous versions of an asset or folder.

To delete an asset or folder:

1.  Select an item.

2.  Click **Mark for deletion**

3.  Confirm your action in the dialog. This marks the asset/folder for deletion and creates a restorable version. The row is grayed out and the item is no longer available in chooser dialogs.

4.  Click **Delete permanently** to complete the deletion. After deleting permanently, you can no longer restore the item.
