# JCR extends

This page explains how you can reuse JCR based configuration of Magnolia definition items with the `extends` mechanism.

The JCR extends mechanism is based on JCR nodes and properties. JCR configuration data can be extended on any node level, and thus on any level of configuration. JCR extends allow to extend sub items of a JCR-defined item definition.

## [](#_overview)Overview

You can extend a JCR configuration by defining an `extends` property and setting its value to the source configuration you want it to inherit. The target configuration inherits everything from the source and adds its own exceptions. This can save time and effort as you only need to define exceptions explicitly. Use `extends` & `override` to exclude sub-nodes of the extended node.

The mechanism is only available in the `config` repository.

In the example below, the `sportstation` site definition extends the `travel` site definition.

The definition inherits all configuration from the `default` configuration and adds its own domains, internationalization and URI-to-repository mappings. The `extends` property can point to the source configuration with an absolute or relative path. The nodes

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `extends` | **optional** Path to the configuration that is extended. |
