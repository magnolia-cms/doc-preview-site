# Live Copy FAQs

-   [General](#_general)

## [](#_general)General

Does editing a live copy affect the `master`?

No. Live Copy is one directional, meaning that pushes are only from `master` to the live copies and not the other way around.

Do all changes made on `master` impact all live copies?

No. You can protect certain components and fields within a Live Copy. For more on this, see [protecting content from master changes](../usage/manage-live-copy/#_protect_content_from_master_content_changes) topic.

Can Live Copy be used via a headless approach?

Yes, Live Copy is headless-ready and can be used in any approach, classical or headless.

## [](#_translationslanguages)Translations/languages

Are live copies language versions?

No, live copies are **not** equivalent to language versions. The `master` site must contain all content (*main language + language versions*), and the live copies are instances of the entire tree.

How does the translation workflow happen?

Translations have to be done in the `master` and pushed to the respective live copies.

Can we restrict access for editors depending on the locale?

An author can have editing rights to the German version of live copy, but when it comes to the master, they only have view rights by default.

Access to the live copies can be restricted to specific users (*e.g., your Spanish editors accessing the `ES` live copy, your German editors accessing the `DE` live copy and so on*).

For example, since installing the Language Availability enables a local editor to have access to only their language on master site, a Spanish editor with editing right to their Spanish live copy would also have access to the Spanish ES language on Master - not only as a viewer but also as an editor.

This means that since the translation of the content takes place in the `master` site, content creators need access to it. If you want to further restrict access within the `master` site so that specific languages can be accessed by specific roles, we have developed an [Language Availability module](../../../languages-availability/) to help with that.
