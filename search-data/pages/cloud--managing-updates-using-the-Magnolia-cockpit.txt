# Managing updates using the Magnolia cockpit

After developing locally and [pushing your changes](../Developing-for-Magnolia-in-the-cloud/Committing-and-pushing-to-the-remote-Magnolia-Git-repository/) to the remote Magnolia Git repository, use the Magnolia [cockpit](../Cockpit/) to retrieve your work.

> **Tip:** To do so, go to the Manage updates page in the Magnolia cockpit.

## [](#_here_you_can)Here you can:

1.  [Deploy a snapshot](deploying-snapshot/).

2.  [Create a release](creating-a-release/).

3.  [Promote a release in the UAT](promoting-a-release-to-UAT/) or in [Live environment](promoting-a-release-to-Live/).

4.  [Copy content for testing](Copying-content-for-testing/).

5.  [Change the version of Magnolia used in your environments](Upgrading-Magnolia-in-the-cloud/).

> **Note:** The options available in Manage updates depend on the current state of your setup: You cannot deploy a snapshot or promote a release until you have set up a new environment.If no snapshot is deployed, you cannot create and promote a release.
