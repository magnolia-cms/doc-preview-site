# Editing images

The DAM provides basic image editing functionality. You can edit all uploaded images in the image editor.

## [](#_image_editor)Image editor

To open the image editor:

1.  Select an image.

2.  Click **Edit asset** in the action bar.

3.  Click the ![Edit image icon](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/6-1-editImageIcon.gif) icon in the **Media** field.

4.  The image editor opens in the same tab.


> **Warning:** If you edit an image directly after upload, the edited image will be stored in the DAM and you will not be able to revert to the uploaded version without re-uploading it. To retain the uploaded version, save it directly after the upload and edit a duplicate.

The image editor displays:

-   **Image** in full size. If the image is larger than the available screen, scroll bars will appear to the right and below the image.

-   **Editing** actions. Edits are executed sequentially (for example, you can crop, rotate and then crop again).

    -   **Crop**: enters the crop mode. The button names change dynamically to **Crop image** and **Cancel** (WARNING: not supported in IE11).

    -   **Rotate**: rotates the image 90° to the right with each click.

    -   **Flip**: flips the image either horizontally or vertically.

    -   **Undo/Redo**: reverts to the state before the last edit action or re-executes the last edit action.


-   **Zoom** the image to fit the window or the actual image size. Once the image is scaled to fit, you can continue to resize your browser and the image will continue to adapt dynamically.

-   **Image size** (in pixels) below the image.

-   **Cancel editing** and **Save changes**. Both actions close the editor and return you to the Asset dialog.


> **Tip:** You can edit a number of images simultaneously by opening the image editor in multiple browser tabs. This is useful when making the same edits to many images (for example, cropping to the same size or flipping).

## [](#_editing_images_in_other_apps)Editing images in other apps

You can edit images directly in other apps that use them. The procedure and actions are identical to those in the Assets app and function in exactly the same way.
