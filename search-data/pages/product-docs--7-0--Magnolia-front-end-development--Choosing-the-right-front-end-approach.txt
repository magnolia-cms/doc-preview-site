# Choosing the right front-end approach

Before starting your Magnolia project, one of the first decisions you make is how to build the front-end.

Magnolia supports two main approaches:

-   **Headless development**

    Magnolia exposes content via APIs, and your front-end application (such as a React, Angular, Vue app or SSR framework like Next.js, Nuxt, or Angular SSR) takes full control of rendering.

-   **FreeMarker-based development**

    Magnolia renders pages and components server side using templating and configuration.


Each approach offers unique advantages, and your choice shapes how content is delivered, how your front-end is structured, and how editors interact with the system.

This page compares the two approaches to help you understand:

-   How each rendering flow works

-   What your YAML and component setup looks like

-   How your editors and site visitors are affected

-   Infrastructure and SEO implications

-   Which Magnolia modules and features are available


| FreeMarker | Headless |
| --- | --- |
| • The user visits a URL in their browser. • Magnolia receives the request. • Magnolia renders the full HTML server side. • Magnolia returns the rendered page to the browser. Magnolia has full control over the HTML structure and delivery. | • The user visits a URL in their browser. • The request is handled by the front-end server (not Magnolia). • The front-end fetches content from Magnolia using REST APIs. • The application renders the page client side or server side (for example, SSR with Next.js). Magnolia provides structured content, but rendering is fully external. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| *Component autogeneration* | Supported. See [Component autogeneration](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Area-definition/Component-autogeneration/) . | Supported since [6.2.35](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Releases/Release-notes-for-Magnolia-CMS-6.2.35.adoc#_improvements) . See [Visual SPA Editor](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/visual-spa-editor/) . |
| *Component inheritance* | Supported. See [Component inheritance](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Area-definition/Component-inheritance/) . | Supported since [6.2.35](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Releases/Release-notes-for-Magnolia-CMS-6.2.35.adoc#_improvements) . See [Visual SPA Editor](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/visual-spa-editor/) . |
| *Component YAML definition* | Magnolia renders the component templates. You specify which FreeMarker template is used to render the page: `templateScript: /hello/templates/components/hello.ftl renderType: freemarker` | The front-end server or browser renders the component templates. Component YAML definitions can be as simple as just the title property. The mapping between template names and JS components is in JS code. For more information, see the [React](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/magnolia-front-end-sdk/magnolia-react-editor/#_properties_3) , [Angular](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/magnolia-front-end-sdk/magnolia-angular-editor/#_editorcontextservice_setcomponentmapping) , and [Vue](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/magnolia-front-end-sdk/magnolia-vue-editor/#_properties_3) properties. |
| *Dialog definition* | Dialog definitions are fully decoupled from template rendering. There are no differences between the FreeMarker and headless templating approaches. |  |
| *Page YAML definition* | Page templates are rendered by Magnolia. You specify which FreeMarker template is used to render the page: `templateScript: /hello/templates/pages/hello.ftl renderType: freemarker` | Page templates are rendered by the front-end server or browser. You only [specify the URL](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/#_spa_only_template_properties) to load in the Pages app. `$type: spa baseUrl: http://localhost:3000 routeTemplate: '/\{language}\{\{@path}}'` The mapping between template names and JavaScript components is in the JS code. For more information, see [React](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/magnolia-front-end-sdk/magnolia-react-editor/#_properties_3) , [Angular](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/magnolia-front-end-sdk/magnolia-angular-editor/#_editorcontextservice_setcomponentmapping) , and [Vue](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/magnolia-front-end-sdk/magnolia-vue-editor/#_properties_3) . |
| *Site Template Prototypes* | Supported. See [Template prototype](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Site-definition/Template-prototype/) . | Supported. See [Template prototype](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Site-definition/Template-prototype/) . A headless template page must have: `$type: siteSpa` See [Common template properties](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Template-definition/#_common_template_properties) . |

|  | **FreeMarker** | **Headless** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *i18n (internationalization of template labels)* | Done via [i18n message bundles](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Language/Internationalization/#_i18n_message_bundle) . | See the Magnolia blog post [Internationalizing Template Labels in SPAs](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/blog/internationalizing-template-labels-in-spas.html) . |
| *p13n (personalization)* | Supported. See [Personalization](../../../RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Personalization/) . | Supported. See [Personalization](../../../RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Personalization/) . For headless templates, an extra step is required. See [Personalization of headless SPA projects](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/personalization-of-headless-SPA-projects/) . |
| *SEO/Social media sharing* | FreeMarker templates are all server-side generated. All SEO/Social media sharing tags work correctly. | For all scenarios that render the site on the server (such as Next.js), all SEO/Social media sharing tags work correctly. For scenarios where JS fetches the page data on the client side in the user browsers, the SEO/Social media sharing tags might not work as expected. |
| *Sitemap* | The recommended approach is a sitemap generated using SOLR. | In the headless approach, Magnolia doesn’t render sites and lacks a comprehensive knowledge of the entire scope of the project structure. The SPA has this knowledge and should be tasked with rendering the sitemap by means of the [Delivery API](../../../../rest/api/delivery-endpoint/) to retrieve Magnolia-managed pages or content app items for URL builds. |
| *Versioning* | Supported. See [Versioning](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Versioning/) . | **Restore** works as expected. **Show version** works but, when fetching data from Magnolia, you must include a [version number in the query parameters](../../../../rest/api/delivery-endpoint/#_parameters_2) read from the iframe URL. **Compare** is not supported. |

| *Caching* | Because Magnolia is responsible for serving the HTML to end users, Magnolia controls caching policies and browser caching policies (we can set response headers to make browser cache content). | Magnolia is responsible for Magnolia caching policies. Regarding browser caching, Magnolia can **ONLY** influence the requests coming to the Delivery API and assets stored in Magnolia. So only those requests reaching Magnolia via: • `/.rest/*` • `/dam/*` • `/.imaging/*` ** You must set browser caching policies on the front-end server. | ** | You must set browser caching policies on the front-end server. |
| ** | You must set browser caching policies on the front-end server. |
| *CDN* | In a typical case where the CDN inherits the caching headers from the original source, Magnolia can influence *all* cache headers. See the *Caching* row above. | In a typical case where the CDN inherits the caching headers from the original source, Magnolia can only influence the following cache headers: • `/.rest/*` • `/dam/*` • `/.imaging/*` HTML document headers are set on the front-end servers. See the *Caching* row above. |
| *Redirects* | Because all requests come to Magnolia, Magnolia controls various redirects using [Virtual URI Mappings](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/URI-mapping/Virtual-URI-mapping/) . | Magnolia can only serve redirects for: • `/.rest/*` • `/dam/*` • `/.imaging/*` This is because only those requests go directly to Magnolia. Other redirects must be handled by front-end servers as the initial requests arrive there. One way of adding the ability to set redirects in Magnolia would involve creating a new Content App to create redirect mappings. The front-end server would then fetch the mappings from Magnolia and apply them. |

| *A/B/n Testing* | [A/B/n Testing](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/ABn-testing/ABn-testing-module/) module. | Not supported on headless. |
| *Campaign manager* | Supported. See [Campaign manager module](../../../../campaign-manager/) . | Supported. See [Campaign manager module](../../../../campaign-manager/) . For headless templates, an extra step is required. For information, see the comments in ticket [SUPPORT-12091](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/SUPPORT-12091) . |
| *Commerce Connector* | [E-commerce](../../../../ecommerce/ecommerce-module/) module. | Supported. |
| *Diff* | [Diff](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Diff-module/) module. | Not supported on headless. |
| *Form* | Magnolia controls the HTML rendering. It allows the creation of forms and also renders them inside FreeMarker templates. FreeMarker-based module allows adding the form processors and custom Java logic to consume and process the data after form submission. | You can use the [Dynamic Form module](#dynamic-form:ROOT:index.adoc) (incubator version) to create forms. This module exposes the REST APIs to: • Fetch the JSON structure of the form, meaning the JS code needs to fetch the form and render it on its own. • Submit the form to store data entered by the user. |
| *JavaScript Models* | [JavaScript Models](../../../../javascript-models/) module. | Not supported on headless. |
| *Live Copy* | Supported. See [Live Copy](../../../../live-copy/4.x/) . | Supported. See [Live Copy](../../../../live-copy/4.x/) . |
| *Marketing Automation (Web-to-lead)* | [Marketing Automation integration framework](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/extensions-and-frameworks/marketing-automation-integration-framework/) . | Supported. |
| *Marketing Tags* | Magnolia has complete control over rendering the HTML Editors can use the [Marketing Tags app](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Marketing-Tags-app/) to define various tags and Magnolia can add them when rendering the page HTML. | You must create a new Delivery API endpoint to fetch marketing tags from the Magnolia workspace for the Marketing Tags app in a headless setup. The front-end server retrieves the tags using this endpoint and integrates them into the JavaScript template, as Magnolia cannot directly modify the HTML head in a headless architecture. |
| *MTK (Magnolia Templating Kit)* | [MTK](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/MTE-module/MTK-module/) module. | Not supported on headless. |
| *Multisite* | [Multisite](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Multisite-module/) module. | Supported. |
| *Pages* | [Pages](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Pages-module/) module. | Supported. |
| *Personalization* | [Personalization](../../../RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Personalization/) module. | Supported. |
| *Public User Registration* | [Public-User-Registration](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Public-User-Registration-module/) module. | Not supported on headless. |
| *User-based search result ranking* | [User Result Ranker](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/User-result-ranker-module/) module. | Not supported on headless. |

## [](#_summary)Summary

Choosing between FreeMarker and headless depends on your project’s goals, team expertise, and technical architecture:

-   Headless is a strong choice if you’re using a modern front-end framework, want full rendering control, or are building a decoupled setup.

-   FreeMarker suits projects where Magnolia handles rendering and a classic CMS architecture is preferred.


You can always revisit this choice later, but it’s best to start with the model that aligns with your long-term strategy.
