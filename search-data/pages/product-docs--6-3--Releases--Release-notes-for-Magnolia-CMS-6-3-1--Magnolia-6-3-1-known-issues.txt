# Magnolia 6.3.1 known issues

## [](#_some_in_app_search_fields_and_filters_not_working)Some in-app search fields and filters not working

We’re investigating an issue with the search improvements introduced in 6.3.1. In-app search for the following apps isn’t working as expected due to a build issue:

-   Definitions app

-   Resource Files app

-   Tasks app


For more details, see:

-   [CFGUI-199](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/CFGUI-199).

-   [MGNLRES-421](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLRES-421).

-   [TASKS-64](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/TASKS-64).


If you rely on search in these apps, please wait until the release of Magnolia 6.3.2. We’re actively working on resolving the issues.

## [](#_assets_cant_be_loaded_or_served)Assets can’t be loaded or served

This issue is caused by the upgrade of the `commons-io` library to version `2.17.0`, where the constructor of `AutoCloseInputStream` changed to

```java
...
public AutoCloseInputStream(InputStream in) {
    super(ClosedInputStream.ifNull(in));
}
...
```

A fix for this issue will be delivered as [BUILD-1297](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/BUILD-1297).

### [](#_workaround)Workaround

As a temporary workaround, downgrade the library to version `2.16.1`.

## [](#_variants_unintentionally_valued)Variants unintentionally valued

Switching between [variants](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Personalization-module/My-first-personalized-campaign/) during editing replaces the target variant being edited with the current value, even if the changes are not saved. This behavior can result in unintended updates to the target variant.

If you use variants, we recommend waiting until the release of Magnolia 6.3.2.

A fix for this issue is delivered with [MGNLUI-9095](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9095).

## [](#_performance_issues_with_the_assets_app)Performance issues with the Assets app

> **Note:** This issue is described in the Magnolia 6.3.0 known issues. It is addressed in 6.3.4 with MGNLUI-9115.
