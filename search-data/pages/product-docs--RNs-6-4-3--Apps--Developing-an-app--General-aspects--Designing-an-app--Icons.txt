# Icons

Icons add visual value to apps and actions. They help users instantly recognize user interface elements. Icons also add familiarity when used consistently across Magnolia.

> **Note:** In Magnolia 6.3, you can not use icons for apps in app launcher anymore. Instead, an app icon must be a file in the SVG image format.See the How to add SVG icons for apps page for more details.

## [](#_font_based_and_image_based_icons)Font-based and image-based icons

In Magnolia 6.x, the icons used come in two forms:

-   As font characters from the pictographic `MagnoliaIcons` font.

-   As SVG [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) images.


The font-based icons are a vector format rather than a bitmap, which means you can style the icons with CSS and display them in various sizes without repeating the asset itself.

The image-based icons are used:

-   In the App launcher.

-   With the app items in the [Global Search](../../../../../Authoring/Search/Global-search/) search results list.

-   In the first tab of every app.


If you are developing a custom content app, you can also provide and use custom SVG icons in it. See the [How to add SVG icons for apps](../../../Specific-aspects/How-to-add-SVG-icons-for-apps/) page for more details.

| Size | Description | Sample |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 16×16px | Search results list |  |
| Default size is 32×32px | App Launcher |  |
| 16×16px | Action bar |  |
| 16×16px | Tab |  |
