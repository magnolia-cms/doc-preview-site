# Cockpit

The Magnolia cockpit is the central point of access to all functionality provided by Magnolia in the cloud. This page gives you a brief overview of the main screens in the cockpit and what actions can be performed.

## [](#_logging_in)Logging in

A URL for the cockpit and login details for all the users you requested are provided by Magnolia when you subscribe to Magnolia’s cloud offering. Use this information to access the cockpit.

You are logged out automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity for security reasons.

## [](#_environments_overview)Environments overview

The package overview page provides an overview of all the *[Environments](Magnolia-cockpit-concepts/#_environment)* and *[Spaces](Magnolia-cockpit-concepts/#_space)* that have been set up for the package.

A Magnolia package typically consists of three environments:

-   **Live** - Where the tested and approved version of the content product is delivered to customers.

-   **UAT** (User Acceptance Testing) - Where the next version of the product is made available to editors and managers for testing and review.

-   **Integration** - Where developers try out ideas and test solutions before giving internal users access.


As features are developed, the configuration is tested and moved from Integration, through UAT and finally to Live.

The **GIT repository** URL for the subscription package is provided: when you [develop locally](../Developing-for-Magnolia-in-the-cloud/), you must push your configuration changes to this GIT repository so they can be promoted in the Integration environment.
