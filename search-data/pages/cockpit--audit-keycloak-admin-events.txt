# Keycloak admin event logs

Keycloak admin event logs provide detailed records of administrative actions and configuration changes within your identity and access management system. These logs help you track who made changes, audit administrative activities, maintain security compliance, and troubleshoot configuration issues.

Each event entry captures essential information about administrative operations, including operation types, the administrator who performed the action, affected resources, timestamps, and the nature of changes made.

By analyzing these logs, you can identify configuration changes, monitor administrative access patterns, track resource modifications, and maintain a complete audit trail of system changes for security and compliance purposes.
