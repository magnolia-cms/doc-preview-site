| No. | Section | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Infrastructure** | DX Cloud runs on Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes clusters are sets of node machines running containerized applications. One of the primary advantages of Kubernetes clusters is that they automatically manage your cluster to match the configured desired state. ** See [Infrastructure](infrastructure/) for more details. |
| **2** | **Environments** | The DX Cloud **Environments** section contains critical information about your deployment’s health, response times, and overall usage. The environments you see in this section of the Cockpit are those configured in your [.gitlab-ci.yml](../../environments/#gitlab-ci-file) file. ** See [Environments](environments/) for more details. |
| **3** | **Networking** | The **Networking** section of the Cockpit lets you create and manage ingresses and certificates, handle redirects and configure your desired redirect settings, and manage secrets. ** See [Networking](networking/) for more details. |
| **4** | **CDN** | Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) allow you to quickly deliver your site content by caching content appropriately for improved speed and performance. DX Cloud uses [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) as the default CDN. If you’re using Fastly as your CDN, you’ll be able to see all available tabs in the Cockpit. ** See [Content delivery](content-delivery/) for more details. |
| **5** | **Security** | The **Security** section of the Cockpit provides a place to configure important security parameters for your site’s deployment such as metrics on the Web Application Firewall (WAF). ** See [Security](security/) for more details. |
| **6** | **Logs** | The DX Cloud **Logs** section in the Cockpit displays logs for pods, domains, ingresses, and more. Each section has dedicated filtering by their relevant components as well as by a date range. ** See [Logs](logs/) for more details. |
| **7** | **Support tickets** | Unresolved include directive in modules/cockpit/pages/sections/support.adoc - include::cockpit:ROOT:support-tickets.adoc[] ** See [Support from the Cockpit](support/) for more details. |
| **8** | **Reports** | The DX Cloud **Reports** section contains important information about your deployment’s SLAs. ** See [Reports](reports/) for more details. |
| **9** | **Audit** | The DX Cloud **Audit** section in the Cockpit displays Keycloak event logs. ** See [Audit](audit/) for more details. |
| **10** | **Admin** | The Admin section lets you manager Cockpit users, AdminCentral groups, and Organisations. It’s a good idea to manage access to your DX Cloud subscription. You an easily handle this using the **Admin** section in your Cockpit. Here, you can create and manage users, and create user groups for your subscription as well as perform administrative operations like password resets, or creating business units (Organisations). ** See [Admin](admin/) for more details. |
