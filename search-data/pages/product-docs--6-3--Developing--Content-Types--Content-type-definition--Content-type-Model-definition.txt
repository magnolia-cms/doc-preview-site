# Content type Model definition

A *model definition*, a subitem of the Magnolia Content type definition, defines the model of a content type. The model describes the properties of a content item such as name, description, asset, birthday, and so on.

In the default JCR-based implementation, the type of the properties can be `String`, `Boolean`, `Decimal`, `Double`, `Long`, `Date`, `asset`, `richText`, another content type or a [submodel](#_submodels). The model can define a list of submodel definitions.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `properties` | **required** A list of property definition objects. |
| `<property>` | A subdefinition item defining one property of the model. Its definition interface is info.magnolia.types.model.PropertyDefinition . ** Read the [Property definition properties](#_property_definition_properties) section for all the details of a PropertyDefinition object. ** Although it’s possible to create a content type definition that doesn’t contain a content property specification in the list of properties, with the intention that you would set the properties later on manually in a configured app, such a content type definition creates an app that: • has a details subapp of type `ConfiguredSubAppDescriptor` rather than `DetailDescriptor` , • offers no **Add item** or **Edit item** actions. To avoid this, define at least one content property in your content type definition. For example, as a minimum property configuration for a fully functional content app, define the `name` property and set its `required` attribute to `true` . `... model: properties: name: required: true` | ** | Read the [Property definition properties](#_property_definition_properties) section for all the details of a PropertyDefinition object. | ** | Although it’s possible to create a content type definition that doesn’t contain a content property specification in the list of properties, with the intention that you would set the properties later on manually in a configured app, such a content type definition creates an app that: • has a details subapp of type `ConfiguredSubAppDescriptor` rather than `DetailDescriptor` , • offers no **Add item** or **Edit item** actions.

| `<submodel>` | A subdefinition item configuring a complete submodel.

If the `nodeType` is not provided, `mgnl:content` is used by default. ** For contentDatasource, node types are not automatically registered in the system.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | **required** The name of the property. The name is used for storing values in the underlying data source. |
| `type` | **optional** , *default is String* Possible values: • JCR property types • `String` • `Boolean` • `Decimal` • `Double` • `Long` • `Date` • `richText` - creates a [Rich text](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Rich-text-field/) field, which is a [custom Magnolia field](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/Custom-fields/) implementing the [CKEditor](http://docs.ckeditor.com) component. • `asset` - creates a [Link field](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Link-field/) to choose an asset. • The name of a [Submodel](#_submodels) . ** You can only reference submodels defined in the same content type. • The name of a [Content type](../../../../../../content-types/2.0.0/) making a reference to another content item. Prefix the value with `reference:` (for example, + `type: reference:tourGuide` ) ** Number zero trimming behavior If you configure a field as `Decimal` or `Double` , values entered with trailing zeros are displayed without them after saving. For example: • `123.01230` is saved and reloaded as `123.0123` • `123.00` is saved and reloaded as `123` This is caused by the way JavaScript and JSON handle numeric types. When a numeric value is parsed or serialized, it’s converted to a minimal numeric representation. If preserving the exact numeric format (including trailing zeros) is required: • Use the `String` type instead to store the exact text representation entered by the user. • Format numbers for display using tools such as `Intl.NumberFormat` , specifying a fixed number of decimal places. Be aware, however, that the formatted output is still a `String` , not a numeric value. | ** | You can only reference submodels defined in the same content type. | ** | Number zero trimming behavior If you configure a field as `Decimal` or `Double` , values entered with trailing zeros are displayed without them after saving.

| `required` | **optional** , *default is false* Makes the property mandatory. |
| `i18n` | **optional** , *default is false* [Enables i18n support](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Language/Language-configuration/#_enabling_multi_language_content) for the property. ** You also need to [enable i18n for a site definition](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Site-definition/#_configuring_a_site_definition) .

## [](#_submodels)Submodels

Use submodels to define complex content types.

Submodels are useful whenever you need a group of fields more than once. A content type model definition can contain a list of submodel definitions within the `subModels` property. Submodels can be used only within the content type where they have been defined.

> **Important:** A submodel definition has the same properties as a model, but a submodel cannot have additional submodels.The default nodeType for a submodels is mgnl:contentNode.

## [](#_referencing_content_types)Referencing content types

Projects often have multiple content types, and those types can reference each other. For example you could have a Book type and a Publisher type. The Book could have a reference to the Publisher type. Then in Magnolia authors can manage publishers in one app, and books in another app. The form for the Book app will include a control to select a Publisher for that app. This common use-case is easy to configure in the content type.

bookType example

```yaml
type: reference:bookType (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Prepending `reference:` allows you to reference another content item. |

## [](#_interfaces_and_classes)Interfaces and classes

### [](#_model)Model

The base model interface is info.magnolia.types.model.ModelDefinition and info.magnolia.types.model.ConfiguredModelDefinition is set as the default implementation class.

### [](#_submodel)Submodel

The submodel item is defined by the info.magnolia.types.model.SubModelDefinition interface, which extends info.magnolia.types.model.ModelDefinition.
