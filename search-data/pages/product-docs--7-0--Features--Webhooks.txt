# Webhooks

## [](#_webhooks_in_general)Webhooks in general

### [](#_what_is_a_webhook)What is a webhook?

A webhook is a user-defined callback, triggered by some event (content change or a code push to a repository), which makes a REST call to an external API, usually a build pipeline. The build system then creates a new build that incorporates the changed content.

### [](#_common_use_cases)Common use cases

-   **Triggering a build**

    The most common use for webhooks in a CMS is to trigger building a static site ([Jamstack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack)) whenever content is changed.

-   **Updating search indexes**

    You can configure a webhook to trigger a specific search service. Upon executing a webhook, the service will perform a re-indexing of content.

-   **Sending notifications**

    A webhook can be configured to send a request to a messaging service in order to send notifications to staff members or site users.

-   **Synchronizing content**

    Last but not least, a webhook can be configured to send a request to a third-party service to orchestrate moving or updating content on a CDN or database.


## [](#_support_for_webhooks_in_magnolia)Support for webhooks in Magnolia

Magnolia Webhooks is a DX Core feature and has been available since the 6.2.22 Magnolia release. In the Magnolia implementation, webhooks are:

-   Configured in Yaml files.

-   Registered in a webhook registry.

-   Triggered by the `PUBLISH` or the `UNPUBLISH` event(s).

-   Configured for event definitions that are based on Magnolia [Content Types](../Content-Types/).

-   Queued for asynchronous processing to avoid the interruption of the main UI thread.

-   Filterable by:

    -   Path

    -   Repository

    -   Node Type

    -   AND/OR filter operations

    -   Recursion



### [](#_webhook_rest_configuration_parameters)Webhook REST configuration parameters

Webhook REST requests can be configured using the following parameters:

-   URL

-   REST method

-   Query parameters

-   Headers

-   List of webhook events


### [](#_webhook_rest_request_configuration_options)Webhook REST request configuration options

There are two ways you can configure a webhook REST request.

1.  Provide REST request properties together with webhook event definition properties in one Yaml file. In this case, a new REST client is created automatically:

    ```yml
    name: webhook1
    url: https://my.server.com/webhookEndpoint
    method: POST
    queryParameters:
      access_token: '2cf09447'
    headers:
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
      "X_Custom_Header": "value"
    enabled: true

    events:
      - name: contentPublished
        eventType: Published
        entity: Content
        filter: "@path LIKE '%whatever%' or @nodeType = 'mgnl:page'"
      - name: contentUnpublished
        eventType: Unpublished
        entity: Content
        filter: "@path LIKE '%whatever%' or @nodeType = 'mgnl:page'"
    ```

2.  To avoid redundant configuration, you can use (reference) an existing REST client definition, as shown in the following example configuration:

    ```yml
    name: webhook1
    restClientName: existingCreatedRestClient
    restCallName: triggerBuild
    enabled: true

    events:
      - name: contentPublished
        eventType: Published
        entity: Content
        filter: "@path LIKE '%whatever%' or @nodeType = 'mgnl:page'"
      - name: contentUnpublished
        eventType: Unpublished
        entity: Content
        filter: "@path LIKE '%whatever%' or @nodeType = 'mgnl:page'"
    ```
