# Admin

The Admin section lets you manager Cockpit users, AdminCentral groups, and Organisations.

It’s a good idea to manage access to your DX Cloud subscription. You an easily handle this using the **Admin** section in your Cockpit. Here, you can create and manage users, and create user groups for your subscription as well as perform administrative operations like password resets, or creating business units (Organisations).

## [](#_manage_users)Manage users

You can manage existing users directly from the Cockpit. This includes:

-   [Adding a user](#_adding_a_user)

-   [User status](#_user_status)

-   [Editing a user](#_editing_a_user)

-   [Deleting users](#_deleting_users)

1.  Go to **Admin > Users**.

2.  Scroll to the desired user.

3.  Click **Reset credentials**. In the dialog, choose to:

    -    Reset password *Initiates password reset process*

        ![create user group](../../_images/access-management/create-user-group.jpg)



### [](#_group_access_admincentral)Group access AdminCentral

If using the [SSO module](../../../../magnolia-sso/) for authentication, you need to ensure the groups created in the Cockpit are granted access via the configuration in the SSO module.

1.  Create a [group](#_create_user_group) in the Cockpit.

    > **Note:** No special roles are needed for AdminCentral access.

2.  Assign users to the group. These are the users who you want to be able to access AdminCentral.

3.  In the SSO module, ensure the group name created in the Cockpit is defined in the `config.yaml` file. See the [SSO module configuration section](../../../../magnolia-sso/#_configure_via_yaml) for more details.

    ```yaml
    path: /.magnolia/admincentral
    callbackUrl: http://localhost:8080/.auth
    postLogoutRedirectUri: http://localhost:8080/.magnolia/admincentral
    authorizationGenerators:
      - name: groupsAuthorization
        groups:
          targetProperty: groups
          mappings:
            - name: /COCKPIT_GROUP (1)
              targetGroups: (2)
                - editors
              targetRoles: (3)
                - editor
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | Where `/COCKPIT_GROUP` is the name of the group you created in the Cockpit. If using Keycloak, the leading `/` is mandatory. |
    | **2** | Defines the target group for the mapped group. |
    | **3** | Defines any particular target roles for the group. |


## [](#_add_organisation)Add Organisation

You can create an **Organisation** so that you can group access to certain parts of your DX Cloud project based on a business unit or organisation. You can define access to clusters, domains, and namespaces this way and explicitly choose the users that are part of the unit.

1.  Go to **Admin > Organisations**.

2.  Click **Add**.

    1.  Give the organisation a meaningful name.

    2.  Give the organisation a meaningful description.

## [](#_federations)Federations

Federations enable your organization to integrate external Identity Providers (IdPs) with our DX Cloud platform through OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols or SAML. In the DX Cloud Cockpit, you can configure Federations to establish trusted relationships with third-party identity systems, configure Cockpit and Rancher mappings, as well as define user attribute mappings between your external IdP and platform resources.
