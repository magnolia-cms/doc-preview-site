# Troubleshooting

## [](#_alerts)Alerts

It’s recommended that server-related resources be monitored regarding performance. See the [Logging and monitoring](../../Logging-and-monitoring/) section for more on how to inspect resources. In particular, keep an eye on responsiveness, capacity, speed, and load to detect potential issues ahead of time. For example:

-   Slow responses on the author or public instances

-   High memory load

-   File system is almost full or filling up quickly

-   Tomcat showing a high load or slow requests


> **Tip:** DX Cloud is a digital Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering and includes out-of-the-box guidance for common troubleshooting scenarios.
