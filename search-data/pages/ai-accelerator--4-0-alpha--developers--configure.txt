# AI provider configuration

The Magnolia AI Accelerator uses configuration files to control both the user interface and AI provider connections. These yaml files define how AI-assisted components behave, which fields are available, and how external AI services are accessed. Each supported provider has its own configuration, including API keys, deployment settings, and optional customizations.
