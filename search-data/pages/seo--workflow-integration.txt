# Workflow integration

[Deprecated](../../incubator-modules/deprecations/)

Search Engine Optimization auditors can be executed within a Magnolia workflow. You can use the results of executed auditors in a workflow.

> **Note:** This feature was added in v5.6.1.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | String, either `passed` or `failed` . The status depends on the settings of `failOnErrors` , `failOnWarnings` and `failOnNotes` for the `ExecuteAuditHandler` instance and the results of the audit. |
| `errors` | Integer, the number of errors found by the executed auditors. |
| `warnings` | Integer, the number of warnings found by the executed auditors. |
| `notes` | Integer, the number of notes found by the executed auditors. |
