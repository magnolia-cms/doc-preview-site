# Resource Files app

The Resource Files app displays [resources](../../../Developing/Resources/) such as CSS files, JavaScript files, template scripts and [YAML](../../../Developing/YAML/) configuration files. You can use the app to edit resources in the JCR `resources` workspace and do [hotfixes](../../../Modules/Module-configuration/#_hotfixing).

-   **Type**: Resource type according to a MIME type, for example `text/x-java-properties` for i18n message bundles or `text/x-yaml` for .yaml definitions. For a full list of MIME types, see for example the [All known MIME types](https://www.digipres.org/formats/mime-types/) (DigiPres Commons) page.


In addition, the following filters are available:

-   **Overrides?**: Does the resource override another resource? See also [Overriding resources](../../../Developing/Resources/#_overriding_resources).
