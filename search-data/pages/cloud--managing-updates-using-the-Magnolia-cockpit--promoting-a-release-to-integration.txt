# Promoting a release to Integration

Once a release has been [created](../creating-a-release/) it can be promoted the Integration, UAT (User Acceptance Testing), or Live environment. Typically, a new release is first promoted to Integration, then UAT for testing.

        > **Note:** Promoting the release may take a few minutes. As all actions in the cockpit are asynchronous, you can click on OK before the promotion is complete: the action will run in the background and a notification will appear once it is complete.The promotion action appears in the activity log and a notification banner is displayed. The new release details are displayed in Environments section of the Package overview page.



## [](#_test_changes_on_updated_environment)Test changes on updated environment

To check that the environment is running on the correct release:

-   Click **Edit content** in **Author space** of the environment in which you promoted the release.

-   Log in to Magnolia and check that the updates included in the release are present. You may want to check changed style (due to updated webresources) or create new content with new features.


> **Warning:** Avoid hotfixing problems in the Resources app because the changes are not propagated back to your git repository.
