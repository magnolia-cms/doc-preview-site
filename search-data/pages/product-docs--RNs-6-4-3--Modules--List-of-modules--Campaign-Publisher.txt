# Campaign Publisher

Campaign Publisher allows managers and team members to manage all elements of online campaigns in a single app. You can add content to campaigns directly in the app where the content is managed. By default, the **Add to campaign** action is available in the Pages and Assets apps but can also be added to any content app.

At a glance, you can see a campaign’s readiness and publication status of each item in the Campaign Publisher app. Team members can preview each campaign item and publish the entire campaign in a single click.

> **Note:** The Campaign Publisher module and app are compatible with Pages and Assets apps (6 UI).There is an ongoing effort to convert the Campaign Publisher module and app to the entire 6 UI framework.
