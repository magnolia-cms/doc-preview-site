# Password field

`PasswordFieldDefinition` renders a [text field](../Text-field/) that masks input values when used only with custom actions. When using ValidatingPasswordFieldDefinition, a global password policy validation is automatically applied through the [Admincentral module](../../../../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Admincentral-module/#_global_password_policy_validation). This policy enforces password strength requirements, including minimum length, character types, and special characters.

> **Warning:** Passwords can be revealed in plain text when the field is used in dialogs with a standard commit action.

If you want to store hashed password values, you can use the field to collect the value entered by the user and delegate storing and hashing the password to an underlying [user manager](../../../../../../Modules/List-of-modules/LDAP-Connector-module/#_user_manager). The user manager may be internal or external (see the [Security app](../../../../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/) for more information).

> **Important:** If you store a hashed value, you can no longer decode it into plain text. This is suitable when you want to authenticate the password and compare the stored hash against the hash of the password provided when logging in. If you need passwords in plain text so that they can be used to access other systems requiring authentication, you should use the Password Manager module.

> **Note:** This password field definition is part of the Magnolia 6 UI framework. The fully qualified class name is info.magnolia.ui.field.PasswordFieldDefinition.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `confirmDialogForUserSessionInvalidation` | **optional** , *default is false* When a user changes their password, this property controls whether a confirmation dialog is displayed, allowing users to invalidate all active sessions. If you set this property to `true` , users are prompted to confirm session invalidation. The user’s active sessions are invalidated immediately, without showing a confirmation dialog, if you omit the property or set it to `false` . Example usage `password: class: info.magnolia.ui.field.ValidatingPasswordFieldDefinition confirmDialogForUserSessionInvalidation: true properties: currentPassword: ...` |

| No language identifier is displayed next to the field’s name. The field value you edit there and save is stored only for the selected language variant. | A two-letter language identifier (for example, `en` , `de` , `fr` ) is displayed next to the field, as shown below on the right side of the screenshots - `en` or `de` next to the "Body Text" name of the rich text field. The field value you edit there and save is stored only for the selected language variant. |
