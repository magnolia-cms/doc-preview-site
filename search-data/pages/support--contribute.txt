# Contribute to Magnolia

If you have some time on your hands and like what you see, why not participate and make Magnolia even better? There are many ways you can support us: spread the word, write code, or simply share time, knowledge or funds with us.

## [](#_answer_questions_on_the_mailing_lists)Answer questions on the mailing lists

Even if you just got started with Magnolia, you might know more than the person asking a question. You are very welcome to share your knowledge on our [forum](https://groups.google.com/a/magnolia-cms.com/g/user-list).

## [](#_write_documentation)Write documentation

If you like to write documentation and have some time on your hands, there are many issues that need documenting. If you have learned something, [write](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10039&issuetype=10014) it down and share it. No need to get fancy with graphics and stuff. A small how-to in plain text is a good start.

If you had to write documentation for your users, your IT department or your grandma, why not share it with the rest of the Magnolia community? They might have grandmas, too.

## [](#_translate_the_user_interface)Translate the user interface

Magnolia comes with an internationalized UI. This allows users to choose the interface language they want. Even if you do not have the ambition to completely translate Magnolia, you might have time to add a couple of translations or correct erroneous ones in your own language. We run the internationalization effort as a community project so please check out the [Language Bundles project in JIRA](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/LANG) and help out!

## [](#_report_bugs)Report bugs

If you use Magnolia and find a bug, report it in the [Jira issue tracker](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/). Make sure it’s a bug and not simply a configuration issue. Check the bug tracker to see if it has been reported before. Add it to the bug tracker if no one else has done so.

If you don’t know whether something is a bug or a configuration issue, check the [forum](https://groups.google.com/a/magnolia-cms.com/g/user-list) for similar problems. If in doubt, post it on the forum and, if the general agreement is that it is a bug, add it to the issue tracker.

Writing bug reports is a fantastic way to contribute to a project, and we are very thankful for each [well written bug report](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html). The better your report is researched and written, the faster the bug will be fixed.

Of course, you are also welcome to download the latest code from [Magnolia GitLab](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/) and test it.

## [](#_spread_the_word)Spread the word!

If you like Magnolia, one way to help us is to promote us - spread the word.

### [](#_report_magnolia_sites_and_success_stories)Report Magnolia sites and success stories

If you have built a website with Magnolia let us know about it - we will add you to the growing [customer list](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/customers.html).

### [](#_write_about_magnolia)Write about Magnolia

If you have the possibility to write an article about Magnolia, do so. Publish it on your blog, your website or in a magazine. Let us know about it, we will be sure to promote your work.

### [](#_talk_about_magnolia)Talk about Magnolia

You are a conference speaker? Great! Talk about Magnolia - even if you only mention it, you will help Magnolia to gain more popularity. Of course, you are also welcome to speak about the system on the radio or the TV. If all else fails, talk to your dog. It is unlikely to significantly promote Magnolia but maybe it helps.

### [](#_link_to_magnolia)Link to Magnolia

You have created a website with Magnolia or simply like what we do? Link to us! Of course we are also happy if you let us know about your Magnolia site so that we can link to you.

Other ideas? Let us know! Are you the creative type? Share your ideas of promoting Magnolia with us!
