    Magnolia 6.4 is a Jakarta EE 10 web application, requiring Tomcat 10.1 (or later).

    Check Apache’s [Apache Tomcat - Which Version Do I Want?](http://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html) page to find out about compatibility between Tomcat and Java versions.


The following servers (latest versions) are not certified, only supported. We provide support for them if you use them, but we do not proactively test them for major or maintenance releases of Magnolia.

> **Note:** We don’t proactively test Magnolia for use with the emerging browsers but we do our best effort to give support for them if you use them.

Admincentral UI is designed for desktop or small screens and tablets.
