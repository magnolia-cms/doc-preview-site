## [](#_breaking_changes)Breaking changes

### [](#_removal_of_the_bypassworkspaceacls_property)Removal of the `bypassWorkspaceAcls` property

For security reasons, we’ve removed the `bypassWorkspaceAcls` property from the [template annotations endpoint](../../Developing/API/SPA-templating-API/#_spa_template_annotations_endpoint).

To maintain the ability to edit your SPA project, you can implement several solutions. The recommended one is the following:

1.  First, create a user in Magnolia specifically for the purpose of making requests from your frontend.

2.  Then, assign it a role with write access to the `website` repository.

3.  Finally, update the frontend project to include the username and password via basic authentication when it makes requests to the Magnolia endpoints.


For the other solutions, see the [`bypassWorkspaceAcls` property](../../Developing/API/SPA-templating-API/#_bypassworkspaceacls_property).

We also suggest enhancing the security of the author instance through additional measures, such as restricting access to specific IP addresses (through `/server/IPConfig`) or placing it behind a firewall.
