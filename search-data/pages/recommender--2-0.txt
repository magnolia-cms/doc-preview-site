## [](#_usage)Usage

Scoring helps to identify interest in certain products, product groups, services, or topics. The identified interest scores help you to display personalized experiences.

This section is a general introduction to usage. For version-specific usage, please see:

-   [Magnolia 6.x](score-models-6.x/)

-   [Magnolia 5.x](score-models-5.x/)


### [](#_understanding_score_models)Understanding score models

Score models identify a customer’s interest when they browse your site. Their interest is captured in the form of interest points. For example, events like clicking links or page visits indicate interest on certain topics. Watching a video or interacting with the page may indicate even higher interest. These important events make up a dimension of the score model.

Not every interaction indicates the same amount of interest. Therefore you can adjust the number of value points to be assigned per specific event. Score assignment can be fine-tuned by first visit, recency, and frequency. For example, frequent and recent visits normally indicate a strong interest in a topic and should be weighted higher than points assigned for a first time visit.

Together these events, their weights, and frequencies make up the score model.

#### [](#_assigning_score_models)Assigning score models

Score models can be assigned in a couple different ways. They can be applied directly in the Pages app or in your custom content apps.

-   Page view scoring is handled in the browser subapp. Click Edit Score Model, then assign points for visiting that page.

-   Scoring interactions with components is handled in the page editor. Use the Score model assignment tab in the component dialog.


### [](#_using_centralized_analytics)Using centralized analytics

The module does not collect any analytics data. However, integration into your existing analytics solution is straightforward. Extend the `recommender.js` file and add custom tracking events in the `MgnlScoreModel#trackEvent()` method.

Here are some links that should help determine how to add the events.
