# Managing cloud log levels

Magnolia Cloud integrates with [Datadog for monitoring and logging](../) services.

This page explains where you can change the level of logs displayed for your Magnolia cloud instance and add loggers in the cockpit.

> **Note:** If you want to access Magnolia cloud instance logs and integrate them with other external tools, use the REST API logs endpoint.The log displayed is the catalina.out log.

## [](#_setting_log_levels)Setting log levels

4.  Select the required log level for each logger using the drop-downs on each line.

    > **Important:** The levels available are standard Log4J log levels: ALL; TRACE; DEBUG; INFO; WARN; ERROR; FATAL; OFF.Any change you make in the loggers is applied immediately to the instance you selected. You can see this by logging into the instance inquestion and looking in Tools > Log Tools app > Log Levels tab.If the Log Tools app is open when you change the log levels in the Cockpit, you must close the app and open it again to see your changes reflected.When the instance is restarted, the logs are set back to their default levels.
