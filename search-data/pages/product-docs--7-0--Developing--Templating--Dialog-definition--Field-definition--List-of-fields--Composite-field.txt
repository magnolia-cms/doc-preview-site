# Composite field

`CompositeFieldDefinition` renders a complex field composed of one or more fields (`compositeField`). Use the field for objects that cannot be expressed as simple text strings or numbers such as:

-   Setting conditions for selecting the next step in a multistep form.

-   Assigning categories to a content item where the composite field consists of a category dropdown and a button for reordering categories.

-   Defining an image gallery using a media select field where the composite media field consists of a thumbnail and caption text.

-   Specifying an [access control list](../../../../../../Administration/IAM/Roles-and-access-control-lists/) for JCR workspaces where the composite ACL field consists of permission, scope and path.


There is also `JsonCompositeFieldDefinition` to be used in an app with its own [JSON data source](../../../../../../Modules/List-of-modules/REST-Client-module/JSON-data-source/) (`jsonCompositeField`).

> **Note:** These composite field definitions are part of the Magnolia 6 UI framework. Their fully qualified class names are:info.magnolia.ui.field.CompositeFieldDefinitioninfo.magnolia.rest.ui.field.JsonCompositeFieldDefinition

-   Composite field

-   JSON composite field


```yml
composite:
  $type: compositeField
  label: Location
  itemProvider:
    $type: jcrChildNodeProvider
  properties:
    city:
      label: City
      $type: textField
    country:
      label: Country
      $type: textField
```

```yml
field:
  $type: jsonCompositeField
  idPropertyName: name
  properties:
    name:
      label: Name
      $type: textField
      readOnly: true
    to:
      label: To
      $type: textField
      readOnly: true
    operator:
      label: Operator
      $type: textField
      readOnly: true
```

> **Caution:** JSON data source is read-only. Therefore, it only supports read-only fields in, typically, the content detail subapp of a read-only REST app. jsonCompositeField is designed to show field data from REST sources; you can’t add, edit, or delete a field entry.The example above is used in the Stations app contained in the field-examples-module. See also Multi field.

> **Tip:** You can preview this example using the field-examples-module. See Field examples module for more information.
