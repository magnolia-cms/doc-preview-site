## [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

-   First, you’ll need to [get Magnolia](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Hello-Magnolia/Getting-Magnolia.adoc) if you haven’t installed it already.


## [](#_what_are_we_going_to_do)What are we going to do?

**Tutorial overview**

-   We’ll locate the *light module* folder in the Magnolia installation directory.

-   Then, we’ll add *page and component templates* in subfolders.

-   Next, we’ll add *dialog files* in subfolders.

-   Finally, we’ll create a page using the dialogs and templates from the previous steps.


Key

-   You’ll create one folder.

-   You’ll create two folders.

-   You’ll add one file into a folder.

-   You’ll add two files into a folder.

-   ![Download icon](6.2@product-docs:ROOT:icons/download.svg) You’ll need to download one file.

-   ![Download icon](6.2@product-docs:ROOT:icons/download.svg) ![Download icon](6.2@product-docs:ROOT:icons/download.svg) You’ll need to download two files.

| • Find the `light-modules` folder inside the Magnolia installation directory. For example purposes, let’s say you named the installation folder magnolia. The `mgnl jumpstart` command created the `light-modules` for you when installing Magnolia. ** Your Magnolia installation continually monitors the `light-modules` folder, and any folders or files created there are added to the definitions available in Magnolia. | ** | Your Magnolia installation continually monitors the `light-modules` folder, and any folders or files created there are added to the definitions available in Magnolia. | The default root folder structure after installation with [Magnolia CLI v4](#4.x@magnolia-cli:ROOT:magnolia-cli.adoc#_jumpstart) is below. 📁 magnolia 📁 apache-tomcat 📁 downloads 📁 light-modules | 📁 magnolia | 📁 apache-tomcat | 📁 downloads | 📁 light-modules |

| • Creating the module folder, template folder and files. • ** ** In `light-modules` , create a `hi-magnolia` subfolder and then a `templates` folder inside it. • ** Create another subfolder called `pages` . • ** ** Add both page template files , [magnolia123.yaml](_attachments/templates/pages/magnolia123.yaml) and [magnolia123.ftl](_attachments/templates/pages/magnolia123.ftl) . ** Page templates (files with the YAML extension) contain details about areas on a page and how pages are turned into HTML. Template scripts (ones with an FTL extension) turn those templates into final HTML page files. | ** | Page templates (files with the YAML extension) contain details about areas on a page and how pages are turned into HTML.

| • Creating the component template folder and files. • ** Create a `components` subfolder inside the `templates` folder. • ** ** Add the `paragraph` component template files inside it, [paragraph.yaml](_attachments/templates/components/paragraph.yaml) and [paragraph.ftl](_attachments/templates/components/paragraph.yaml) . • ** ** Add the `title` component template files inside it as well, [title.yaml](_attachments/templates/components/title.yaml) and [title.ftl](_attachments/templates/components/title.ftl) . ** Component templates refer to single components on a page such as text, images, and links, much in the same way page templates refer to areas as a whole. | ** | Component templates refer to single components on a page such as text, images, and links, much in the same way page templates refer to areas as a whole. | 📁 hi-magnolia 📁 templates 📁 components paragraph.yaml paragraph.ftl title.yaml title.ftl | 📁 hi-magnolia | 📁 templates | 📁 components | paragraph.yaml | paragraph.ftl | title.yaml | title.ftl |

| • Creating the dialog folders and files. • ** Create a `dialogs` subfolder inside the `hi-magnolia` folder. • ** ** Under that, create two subfolders, `pages` and `components` . • ** ** Copy the component dialog files, [paragraph.yaml](_attachments/dialogs/components/paragraph.yaml) and [title.yaml](_attachments/dialogs/components/paragraph.yaml) , into the `components` folder, as depicted on the right • ** Copy the page dialog file, [magnolia123.yaml](_attachments/dialogs/pages/magnolia123.yaml) , into the `pages` folder, as depicted on the right ** Dialogs are how authors enter content into Magnolia. Dialog definitions specify editable fields where editors can add or update the content itself. In addition, they may define operations that authors can do on the content, for example, commit or cancel. | ** | Dialogs are how authors enter content into Magnolia.
