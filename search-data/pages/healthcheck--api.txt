# REST API

[Deprecated](../../incubator-modules/deprecations/)

The Extended Health Check module comes with a REST endpoint:

```none
/.rest/health/v1/check
```

Returns the health check results with:

-   `healthy` - true if the instance considers itself healthy (HTTP 200) or false if the conditions of some health outcome were met (HTTP status of the health outcome)

-   `description` - the description of the health outcome or "Magnolia is healthy" if healthy


Returns an HTTP status of:

-   `200` - the instance is healthy

-   the HTTP status of the health outcome


## [](#_reset_magnolia_health_events)Reset Magnolia health events

Get `/.rest/health/v1/reset`

> **Note:** Resets may not change Magnolia health status if a health outcome uses health voters like ContextAvailableVoter, MagnoliaUpdateNeededVoter or QueryVoter that do not use health events.

### [](#_returns)Returns

`200` - all health events removed

## [](#_retrieve_magnolia_health_events)Retrieve Magnolia health events

Get `/.rest/health/v1/dump`
