# Headless development guidelines

Magnolia, as a headless CMS, is as powerful for developers as it’s intuitive for content authors.

This section helps front-end developers implement Magnolia in a decoupled setup using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, Angular SSR, and Nuxt.

## [](#_why_choose_headless)Why choose headless?

You’re likely choosing a headless approach for:

-   A fast, flexible, framework-agnostic front-end

-   Clean separation of concerns

-   Maintainability and performance


Magnolia enhances this with:

-   [Visual SPA Editor](../../Developing/headless/visual-spa-editor/): A WYSIWYG page editor for structured content in SPAs

-   [Content apps](../../Apps/Developing-an-app/My-first-content-app/): Form-based content management

-   [Hierarchical content](../../Apps/App-configuration/Content-view-definition/#_view_types): Built-in tree structures

-   [Deep integration capabilities](../../Developing/headless/concepts/integration/): With IUX and connectors to external systems
