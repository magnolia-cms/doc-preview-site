| --- | --- |
| `magnolia-periscope-core` | Provides the default search result supplier and periscope operation configuration files. |
| `magnolia-periscope-api` | Provides an API to plug in search result suppliers to the search result set, as well as to create your own query sniffers (for example, for vocal commands). |
| `magnolia-speech-recognition` | Provides speech-to-text recognition capabilities. |

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.periscope</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-periscope-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.10</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.periscope</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-periscope-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.10</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

> **Note:** The functionality of the QuerySniffer and OperationRequest components is now handled by the Global Search system. The magnolia-speech-recognition code is no longer linked to the new Global Search functionality. This obsolete code is non-functional and will be removed to streamline the codebase.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `class` | **required** , *default is info.magnolia.periscope.search.jcr.JcrSearchResultSupplierDefinition* Fully qualified class name of the supplier definition. Must implement the `info.magnolia.periscope.search.SearchResultSupplierDefinition` interface. |
| `workspace` | **required** Name of the [workspace](../../../Administration/Architecture/Workspaces/) in the `magnolia` repository you want to search. |
| `appName` | **optional** Name of the app that opens when a search result is clicked. |
| `nodeTypes` | **required** List of node types you want to search. If no value is specified, the supplier will search all node types. |
| `titleProperty` | **required** Title of the searched node. Always searched by default and used as a title for the result. |
| `nodeNameProperty` | **required** *default is jcrName* Restricts the search only to match a specific node name. |
| `rootPath` | **optional** , *default is /* Path configured as the root of the workspace. Only content below the path is operated on. |
| `enabled` | **optional** , *default is true* When `false` , the supplier is disabled. |
| `fullTextSearch` | **optional** , *default is true* When `false` , only node names are searched. See also the `propertySearch` property. |
| `propertySearch` | **optional** , *default is false* When `true` , only property names are searched. See also the `fullTextSearch` property. |
| `resultLimit` | **optional** , *default is 100* Limit on the total number of search results that can be retrieved. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | **optional** , *default is 15* Specifies the timeout duration in seconds for individual search supplier operations. **Behavior** • Each supplier operates independently with its own timeout. • If a supplier exceeds its timeout, it returns empty results, but other suppliers continue processing and return results as normal. • The overall search operation completes, aggregating results from all finished suppliers. • Timeouts are handled gracefully, with no exceptions thrown to the client. ** • Lower values (5–10 seconds): For faster responses, but complex searches may be truncated. • Higher values (30–60 seconds): For more comprehensive searches, but expect potential delays. • Balance search thoroughness with user experience. • Monitor supplier performance to fine-tune timeout values for specific use cases. | ** | • Lower values (5–10 seconds): For faster responses, but complex searches may be truncated. • Higher values (30–60 seconds): For more comprehensive searches, but expect potential delays. • Balance search thoroughness with user experience. • Monitor supplier performance to fine-tune timeout values for specific use cases. |

| `strategy` | **optional** , *default is info.magnolia.periscope.search.jcr.JcrSearchResultSupplierStrategy* Strategy used to construct a search result supplier from `JcrSearchResultSupplierDefinition` . Must implement the `info.magnolia.periscope.search.SearchResultSupplierStrategy` interface. |
| `order` | **optional** Node containing the order configuration of search results. See the info.magnolia.periscope.search.jcr.JcrSearchResultSupplierOrder class. |
| `property` | **required** Node type property to sort search results by. Use a [Magnolia node type](../../../Administration/Architecture/Node-types/) or define your own property. |
