# Upgrading to Magnolia 6.3

This page has information about upgrading to Magnolia 6.3 from earlier and [currently supported versions](../../../support/release-support-and-life-cycle/). Before starting the upgrade process, we recommend you:

-   Update to the latest maintenance release of Magnolia `6.2` first.

-   Read the [release notes](../Releases/) for the version you are upgrading to as well as for all intermediate versions.

-   Read the [certified stack](../Administration/Certified-stack/).

-   Be aware that breaking changes affecting browser subapp definitions were introduced in 6.3.1. If you’re upgrading to 6.3.1 or later, after reading this page (notably the section on [Pages and Assets app definition changes](#_pages_and_assets_app_definition_changes)), make sure you also refer to [Upgrading to Magnolia 6.3.1 and later](../upgrading/upgrading-to-magnolia-631/).


If you are upgrading from a Magnolia release that has already reached its EoL (End of life), [contact us](mailto:info@magnolia-cms.com) for migration support.

DX Cloud customers

You must update your helm chart to the latest version. For more, see [Magnolia 6.3 Helm version](../../../paas/faqs/#_what_is_the_minimum_helm_chart_version_needed_for_magnolia_6_3).

## [](#_summary)Summary

-   **You must not**:

    [Override (hotfix) JCR resources](../Developing/Resources/#_overriding_resources) in the Resource Files app before upgrading to Magnolia 6.3.

-   **You must**:

    1.  As always, update dependency management in your project. Use the `6.3` version of the `dx-core-bundle-parent`.

        -   If you use extensions, import the new extensions BOM.


    2.  Update the publishing receivers configuration.


-   **You might also have to**:

    1.  Convert select JCR definitions to YAML. YAML can no longer inherit from JCR-based definitions.

    2.  Migrate CKEditor4 customizations.

    3.  Obtain your new 6.3 license and set it in your instances before updating your 6.3 bundle.

        > **Note:** If you’ve already obtained the license but forgot to set it, you can set it using a Groovy script.

    4.  Review your site/multisite configurations as they may need some adjustment to work properly on 6.3.

    5.  SSO module

        1.  Remove the outdated SSO Login Extension incubator. The functionality is incorporated in version `4.0.0` of the SSO module.

        2.  If you use SSO 3.1.x and upgrade to 4.0.0, you must change your configuration.


    6.  Migrate Content Editor `v2` and multi-language stories.

    7.  Revalidate your `6.2` user group and role assignments for use in `6.3`. Access control to JCR workspaces, URIs and apps has been updated to newer roles that your editors may not have. Make use of the new default groups in the product: `editors`, `publishers`, and `developers`.

    8.  Check that your REST endpoint definitions work as intended. There are a few changes to optionality of REST properties in 6.3 that may have impact on the functionality of REST delivery in your webapps.

    9.  If you’ve built advanced custom configuration sources or registries, adjust to reworked configuration sources in Magnolia 6.3.

    10.  If you rely on MySQL, update the MySQL repository configuration.

    11.  Adapt module app definitions to match the new App Launcher design.

    12.  Update any decorations that overwrite or enhance the `confirmDeletion` action in the Pages or Assets app.

    13.  Make sure that your decorating configuration files have `config` in the filename, for example, `/rest-services/decorations/cache/config.contentCaching.yaml`. This wasn’t required on the Magnolia 6.2 branch.

    14.  Add new superusers to the `publishers` group if they need to publish.

    15.  Update H2 from version `2.1.x` to `2.3.x`. For more details about the migration, see [H2 database](../Administration/Troubleshooting/H2-upgrade/).



## [](#_platform_updates)Platform updates

### [](#_java_17)Java 17

Magnolia 6.3 requires Java 17, but also runs on Java 21 (latest LTS).

### [](#_jakarta_ee_8)Jakarta EE 8

To keep the updating process from `6.2` straightforward, Magnolia `6.3` remains on the Jakarta EE 8 baseline.

However, in preparation for the upcoming breaking update to Jakarta EE 9+, we have updated the Maven coordinates of the EE 8 API specifications.

Examples

```properties
javax.inject:javax.inject:1 >> jakarta.inject:jakarta.inject-api:1.0
javax.json:javax.json-api   >> jakarta.json:jakarta.json-api
```

To avoid duplicate (yet identical) classes on the classpath, we recommend you do the same by replacing your Maven dependencies with `javax` group id, with their Jakarta EE 8 equivalents under the `jakarta` group id.

Versions of these dependencies are already provided in the Magnolia third-party library BOM, through the `jakarta.jakartaee-bom` import.

> **Note:** See also Certified stack: Maven coordinates.

### [](#_microprofile_config)MicroProfile Config

Magnolia 6.3 embraces [MicroProfile Config](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-config-3.0/microprofile-config-spec-3.0.html), adding state-of-the-art flexibility for external instance configuration. This is applied first to [publishing receivers](../Administration/Instances/Receivers/) config, and requires a project update.

> **Important:** Publishing receivers config must be migrated (see immediately below).

#### [](#_configuring_publishing_receivers)Configuring publishing receivers

Publishing receivers are configured using MicroProfile Config. You can supply MicroProfile configurations using:

-   properties files

-   YAML files

-   system properties or environment variables (and more)


To point to your config file, you must pass the `magnolia.config.locations` as a system property (for example, using Tomcat VM options in the `setenv.sh` configuration file), pointing to the directory where your config file resides (for example `-Dmagnolia.config.locations=/opt/magnolia/mounted-config`).

-   microprofile-config.properties

-   microprofile-config.yaml


```properties
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].name=magnoliaPublic-0
magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].url=http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-0-svc:8080
magnolia.publishing.receivers[1].name=magnoliaPublic-1
magnolia.publishing.receivers[1].url=http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-1-svc:8080
```

```yaml
magnolia:
  publishing:
    receivers:
      - name: magnoliaPublic-0
        url: http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-0-svc:8080
      - name: magnoliaPublic-1
        url: http://dev-magnolia-helm-public-1-svc:8080
```

> **Note:** The default receiver for local development (magnoliaPublic8080) has been removed.Receiver example for local developmentmagnolia.publishing.receivers[0].name=magnoliaPublic
> magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].url=http://{host}:{port}/magnoliaPublic (1)
> magnolia.publishing.receivers[0].enabled=true1Put the path magnoliaPublic in the URL for local development.

#### [](#_previous_magnolia_6_2_definition_in_jcr)Previous (Magnolia 6.2) definition in JCR

In Magnolia 6.2, publishing receivers were configured in JCR, under the `publishing-core` module. This made it difficult to provision instances across multiple environments and configure receivers during installation or startup through various JCR *bootstrapping* techniques.

| Node name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 📁 modules |     |
| 📁 publishing-core |     |
| 📁 config |     |
| ⸬ receivers |     |
| ⸬ magnoliaPublic8080 |     |
| ⬩ url | [http://localhost:8080/magnoliaPublic](http://localhost:8080/magnoliaPublic) |
| ⬩ enabled | true |

## [](#_reworked_configuration_sources)Reworked configuration sources

In 6.3, we have overhauled internals of our definition `Registries` and `ConfigurationSources`, effectively inverting dependency between the two:

-   `Registries` now *pull* definitions from `ConfigurationSources`.

-   Previously, `ConfigurationSources` needed to *push* definitions into `Registries`.


This enables greater flexibility to add custom configuration sources (including fetching from remote backends) and manage dependent definition types. It also streamlines definition observation.

> **Warning:** As a consequence, YAML can no longer inherit from JCR-based definitions through the !inherit directive. You have to inline or migrate the JCR definitions into YAML instead.

## [](#_i18nauthoringsupport)I18nAuthoringSupport

> **Note:** This change affects customers using Live Copy with custom i18n implementations, as well as several incubator modules.

The `I18nAuthoringSupport` interface and the default implementations have been consolidated. Deprecated methods have been removed.

It is no longer configured as an observed component at `/server/i18n/authoring` in JCR, but as a regular component mapping in module descriptor.

`MultiSiteI18nAuthoringSupport` is already reconfigured this way.

> **Important:** If you have a custom I18nAuthoringSupport class configured in JCR, you have to provide it via module descriptor instead.<component>
>   <type>info.magnolia.ui.api.i18n.I18NAuthoringSupport</type>
>   <implementation>com.custom.i18n.CustomI18nAuthoringSupport</implementation>
>   <scope>singleton</scope>
> </component>

## [](#_ckeditor_4_customizations)CKEditor 4 customizations

> **Warning:** CKEditor 4 is End-of-Life (EOL) since 2023 (at ckeditor.com). It’s no longer maintained and doesn’t receive security updates.In Magnolia 6.3, it is deprecated (and in maintenance mode) since the Magnolia 6.3.20 release.The preferred option in Magnolia is to use CKEditor 5.

If you have customized your CKEditor 4, you may continue using it in Magnolia 6.3. For this, you must set the new 6.3 [rich text field field property](../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Rich-text-field/#_field_properties) `ckEditorVersion` to `CKEDITOR_4`.

By default, the property is set to `CKEDITOR_5`.

### [](#_ckeditor_4_migration_to_ckeditor_5)CKEditor 4 migration to CKEditor 5

Magnolia 6.2 uses CKEditor 4 in its rich text field. Magnolia 6.3 is released with CKEditor 5. While most field properties from Magnolia 6.2 are supported, CKEditor 4 and CKEditor 5 are very different in their [core architecture](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/migration-from-ckeditor-4.html#differences-between-ckeditor-4-and-ckeditor-5). For this reason, Magnolia recommends previewing any content transferred from CKEditor 4 in Magnolia 6.2 and checking that the content is published as you want it.

In particular, you should check their compatibility tables for [configuration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/ckeditor4-configuration-compatibility.html) and [plugins](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/ckeditor4-plugin-compatibility.html) to determine which content might be affected. Furthermore, follow their [migration guidelines](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/migration-from-ckeditor-4.html) to ensure a smooth transition of any content.

#### [](#_plugins_in_the_magnolia_ckeditor5_build)Plugins in the Magnolia `ckeditor5-build`

For a list of plugins included in the Magnolia `ckeditor5-build`, see [`ckeditor5.ts`](https://gitlab.com/magnolia-ce/ckeditor5-plugins/-/blob/main/packages/ckeditor5-build/src/ckeditor5.ts?ref_type=heads).

> **Tip:** See also Migration from CKEditor 4 (ckeditor.com/docs/).

## [](#extensions-anchor)Old module packs, new extensions

The modules listed in the table below were previously [incubator modules](../../../incubator-modules/) but are now fully-supported [extensions](../Modules/#_module_types) in Magnolia 6.3.

| Module | New license? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[ai-accelerator:ROOT:index.adoc](#ai-accelerator:ROOT:index.adoc)** |     | Requires a license renewal and is no longer free.<br><br>  <br><br>If you are already using any of these modules, contact your Magnolia account manager. We will provide you with the required license key(s). |
| **[Cloudinary External DAM module](../../../cloudinary/1.3/)** |     | Requires a license renewal and is no longer free.<br><br>  <br><br>If you are already using any of these modules, contact your Magnolia account manager. We will provide you with the required license key(s). |

### [](#_previously_bundled_modules)Previously bundled modules

Some of the modules in the new "Extension" category are previously bundled modules that are now unbundled, meaning you need to install them individually.

-   [Campaign Publisher](../Modules/List-of-modules/Campaign-Publisher/)

-   [LDAP Connector module](../Modules/List-of-modules/LDAP-Connector-module/)

-   [Privacy module](../Modules/List-of-modules/Privacy-module/)


> **Note:** For the latest information about module bundling, see the List of modules on the Modules page.

## [](#_multisite_definitions_in_yaml)Multisite definitions in YAML

In Magnolia 6.3, sites work like any other definition type:

-   They are collected into a conventional registry.

-   They support YAML definitions natively.

-   They are displayed in the Definitions app.


### [](#_configuration_sources_and_paths)Configuration sources and paths

The sources of site definitions have changed considerably since Magnolia 6.3.0. Sites can no longer be configured by decorating the Multisite module configuration.

-   You must move site configuration to `<module-name>/sites/` in your light module, as shown in the [`travel-demo-multisite`](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/modules/demo-projects/-/blob/master/travel-demo-multisite/src/main/resources/travel-demo-multisite/sites) example.

-   You should provide your own fallback site configuration in `<module-name>/sites/fallback.yaml`. Otherwise, the system infers one automatically, with either the English or German locale.


> **Warning:** Sites in multisite/config/sites are still loaded (for backward compatibility) but can’t be decorated.

> **Caution:** In Magnolia 6.2, a fallback site could be a folder. In Magnolia 6.3, it has to be a node.

### [](#_site_app_removed)Site app removed

The Site App module and app are no longer available in Magnolia 6.3.0. Site definitions, including their source locations, can be verified in the Definitions app.

![Site definitions see in the Definitions app](../_images/6-3-0-definitionsApp-sites.png)

## [](#_sso_changes)SSO changes

SSO 4.0.x module introduces several important updates and requirements. This includes compatibility adjustments, mandatory configuration changes, removal of certain classes, optional enhancements like JCR-based fallback login, and considerations for users of the SSO Login Extension module.

For specific actions and modifications needed to ensure a smooth upgrade, see [Upgrading from SSO 3.1.x to 4.0.0](#master@magnolia-sso:ROOT:changelog.adoc#upgrade-sso-anchor).

## [](#_content_editor_definitions)Content Editor definitions

Magnolia 6.3 ships only with `v2` of the Content Editor. If you use the Content Editor or a Content Editor-based app, you must migrate your custom `v1` Content Editor definitions to the scheme used in `v2`.

For more details about migration, see [Content i18n and migration to version 2.1 (and higher)](../Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Editor-module/#_content_i18n_and_migration_to_version_2_1_and_higher).

## [](#_password_module_dependency_in_marketing_automation_module)Password module dependency in Marketing Automation module

## [](#_pages_and_assets_app_definition_changes)Pages and Assets app definition changes

> **Caution:** This section applies if you are upgrading to 6.3.0. If you are upgrading to 6.3.1, disregard this section and refer to Upgrading to Magnolia 6.3.1 and later instead. The remainder of this page remains relevant when upgrading to 6.3.x.In 6.3.1, the filteringWorkbench introduced in 6.3.0 for Pages and Assets apps is deprecated. The in-app search and filter functionality becomes the default for all browser subapps as part of the standard workbench definition instead.

Due to the new search experience, notably the return of in-app search functionality, the Pages and Assets app definition files have changed significantly. This may impact you if you customized the configuration of columns or filters in these apps.

For more information about how to configure in-app filters, see [Configuring search in Magnolia](../Administration/Configuring-search/#_configuring_in_app_search_filters).

> **Note:** The new search experience configuration changes only apply to the Pages and Assets apps. Other apps are unaffected.

### [](#_deletion_workflow)Deletion workflow

In addition to the search experience-related definition changes, two definition changes support the [usability improvements](../Releases/Release-notes-for-Magnolia-CMS-6.3/#_usability_improvements) in the [deletion workflow](../Authoring/Deleting-and-restoring/). Namely, the new action `confirmMarkDeletion` replaces `confirmDeletion`, and the `delete` action is renamed `markDeleted`.

> **Important:** Any decorations that overwrite or enhance the confirmDeletion action in the Pages or Assets app won’t work in Magnolia 6.3 because it uses the new confirmMarkDeletion action.

> **Note:** confirmDeletion is unchanged, so its use in custom modules is unaffected.

## [](#_user_group_and_role_changes)User group and role changes

The system of user roles has been updated in Magnolia 6.3.

> **Note:** In the core of the system is now a unified role naming convention of type <module>-<privilege> (for example pages-publisher, admincentral-editor).

### [](#_superuser_role_modified)Superuser role modified

By default, the `superuser` role doesn’t grant publishing permissions. In particular, a user assigned the `superuser` role doesn’t get messages in the **Tasks** app unless the user is also added to the `publishers` group.

### [](#_publishers_group_modified)Publishers group modified

We have added several new roles to the `publishers` group. This includes roles with permissions to read and write on pages and assets.

> **Important:** If you do not want your publishers to have these permissions, update your groups.

### [](#_new_roles)New roles

-   `admincentral-developer`

-   `admincentral-editor`

    (New role that can block access to URLs.)

-   `asset-editor`

-   `category-editor`

-   `dam-app-core-editor`

-   `dam-app-jcr-editor`

-   `definitions-app-developer`

-   `diff-viewer`

-   `graphql-developer`

-   `imaging-editor`

-   `marketingTag-editor`

-   `page-editor`

-   `pages-app-editor`

-   `resources-editor`

-   `story-editor`

-   `tour-editor`

-   `tourCategory-editor`


### [](#_renamed_roles)Renamed roles

-   `workflow-editor` from `editor`

-   `workflow-publisher` from `publisher`


### [](#_removed_roles)Removed roles

-   `contact-base`

-   `rss-aggregator-base`


### [](#_new_group)New group

-   `developer`


## [](#_removed_compatibility_modules)Removed compatibility modules

The following Magnolia `compatibility` modules were removed from the DX Core webapp:

-   `info.magnolia.categorization:magnolia-categorization-app-compatibility`

-   `info.magnolia.contenttags:magnolia-content-tags-ui-compatibility`

-   `info.magnolia.dam:magnolia-dam-app-compatibility`

-   `info.magnolia.dependencies:magnolia-content-dependencies-ui-compatibility`

-   `info.magnolia.diff:magnolia-diff-compatibility`

-   `info.magnolia.personalization:magnolia-personalization-compatibility`

-   `info.magnolia.workflow:magnolia-workflow-compatibility`


## [](#_changes_in_rest_delivery_api)Changes in REST Delivery API

### [](#_updated_rest_packages)Updated REST packages

Make sure you are using the updated packages in REST version `3.0.0` and later, not the deprecated ones.

**Examples**

-   info.magnolia.rest.delivery.DeliveryContext (deprecated: info.magnolia.rest.delivery.jcr.v2.DeliveryContext)

-   info.magnolia.rest.delivery.OutputStreamWrapper (deprecated: info.magnolia.rest.delivery.jcr.OutputStreamWrapper)


### [](#_check_your_endpoint_definitions)Check your endpoint definitions

You should check your REST endpoint definitions to make sure they work as expected, even if you aren’t using custom values in the definitions.

#### [](#_type_property_required_in_endpoint_definitions)$type property required in endpoint definitions

The `$type` property is now required in endpoint definitions.

Set it to either `jcrDeliveryEndpoint_v2` or to the `jcrPagesDeliveryEndpoint_v2` in your project’s delivery endpoint definitions.

#### [](#_default_value_for_depthinreferencednode)Default value for depthInReferencedNode

Since Magnolia 6.3.0, the default value for the `depthInReferencedNode` property is `1`, not `-1` as before in Magnolia 6.2.x.

#### [](#_default_value_for_maxlimit)Default value for maxLimit

The default value for the `maxLimit` property is `100`. Before, it was `1000`.

#### [](#_jcrpagesdeliveryendpoint_v2_relocated)jcrPagesDeliveryEndpoint\_v2 relocated

The `jcrPagesDeliveryEndpoint_v2` is now part of the Pages module. Its class is info.magnolia.pages.rest.v2.JcrPagesDeliveryEndpointDefinition.

## [](#implementation-aspects-anchor)Deprecations from Magnolia code not reported

To minimize the risk of introducing a faulty configuration into your instance, the Definitions app no longer displays select deprecations and other implementation details, specifically those whose origin is in Magnolia code.

Click to see which error messages are now suppressed.

## [](#_app_launcher_design)App Launcher design

The Magnolia 6.3 [App Launcher](../Authoring/App-Launcher/) uses a modern naming and groupings. The original Magnolia 6.2 **classic naming and grouping** is no longer available in Magnolia 6.3.

If you used a custom configuration of the App Launcher in Magnolia 6.2, you must migrate your definition for the 6.3 App Launcher.

## [](#_general_upgrading_procedure)General upgrading procedure

> **Tip:** Because the upgrade process takes time and is vulnerable to incidents, we recommend you minimize the risk by:cleaning up your system,removing unused data,reindexing everything,and doing a full backup first.

1.  First, upgrade to the latest patch release of your current Magnolia version.

    For example, if you are on Magnolia `6.2.3`, the upgrade path should ideally be `6.2.3` → the last maintenance release in the 6.2 branch → the latest release in the 6.3 branch.

2.  Once Magnolia is running, check the [Definitions app](../Apps/List-of-apps/Definitions-app/) for deprecated or problematic definitions.


### [](#_magnolia_properties_file)`magnolia.properties` file

When upgrading Magnolia, compare your `magnolia.properties` file with the one from the newly released Magnolia bundles. Below are the latest versions of the `magnolia.properties` files for Magnolia 6.3.
