# SSO module changelog

The changelog gives you an overview of the changes made to the **SSO module** at each release.

> **Note:** In Magnolia version 6.2, users can choose between SSO module 3.1 and 4.0, as both are fully compatible. However, for Magnolia 6.4, a direct upgrade to version 5.x or 6.x is necessary. SSO module 4.0.x isn’t compatible with Magnolia 6.4 because of its platform-wide Jakarta EE 10 update. Therefore, to ensure a smooth transition and full system compatibility, users migrating from older SSO versions to Magnolia 6.4 must bypass 4.0.x and proceed directly to SSO 5.0 or 6.0.

| Ticket | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MGNLSSO-340** | ** | Upgrade `pac4j` to the latest `6.2.2` version |

## [](#_upgrading_to_sso_module_6_0_0)Upgrading to SSO module 6.0.0

Similar to the documented upgrade path from SSO 3.1 to SSO 4.0, upgrading from 3.1 to 6.0 requires the same steps described for the [4.x upgrade](#4.0@magnolia-sso:ROOT:changelog.adoc#upgrade-sso-anchor), in addition to [updating to Jakarta](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Upgrading-to-Magnolia/#_jakarta_ee_10).

From SSO 4.x, you can switch directly to SSO 6.0.0 after your Jakarta upgrade is complete. From SSO 5.x, you can switch directly to SS0 6.0.0.
