# Magnolia Component Library

The Magnolia Component Library offers reusable, customizable components and page templates for Magnolia front-end projects.

Also known as *framework prototypes*, it’s fully compatible with Magnolia CLI plugins, like [Create Component plugin](../plugins/available-plugins/create-component-plugin/) and [Create Page plugin](../plugins/available-plugins/create-page-plugin/).

It enables developers to efficiently generate components and pages, providing a foundation for consistent, maintainable front-end applications integrated with Magnolia DXP.

The Magnolia Component Library integrates seamlessly with the [Magnolia Starter Projects](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Magnolia-front-end-development/starter-projects/). It’s designed to work with other projects too, though adjustments may be needed based on the project’s structure and styling.

## [](#_key_features)Key features

-   Developer-friendly: Features a clear, modular structure that’s easy to customize, extend, or replace, streamlining development workflows.

-   CLI-integrated: Seamlessly integrates with Magnolia CLI plugins, such as `create-component` and `create-page`.

-   Composable: Each component includes a dialog, template, and framework-specific implementation for flexible, reusable designs.

-   Customizable: Generated components are added directly to your codebase, providing full ownership and flexibility for modifications.

-   Design-System ready: Serves as an ideal foundation for creating your own component library or reusable design system.


## [](#_whats_included)What’s included

Each Magnolia Component Library includes:

-   Ready-to-use dialogs and template definitions for seamless integration with Magnolia CMS.

-   Front-end components tailored for your chosen framework (React, Vue, Angular, or Freemarker).

-   Full compatibility with Magnolia CLI for automated file generation and mapping, streamlining development.

-   Complete ownership of generated code, enabling easy customization and extension.

-   Built-in support for accessible, responsive, and SEO-optimized components, adhering to web standards.

-   Pre-configured styling with Tailwind CSS, assuming it is set up in your project environment.


## [](#_usage)Usage

Generate a component from a prototype:

```console
npm run mgnl -- create-component <YourComponentName> -p <PrototypeName>
```

Add the component to a specific area during creation:

```console
npm run mgnl -- create-component <YourComponentName> -p <PrototypeName> -a main
```

Explore available prototypes interactively:

```console
npm run mgnl -- create-component <YourComponentName> -p
```

> **Important:** Components are copied, not referenced. When you create a component using the Magnolia Component Library, it’s added as a local file.You own the code and can customize it freely. You’re also responsible for maintaining it.

## [](#_styling)Styling

The Magnolia Component Library uses Tailwind CSS utility classes to style components.

Your project must have Tailwind CSS installed and configured to display styles correctly. Without Tailwind, components will render but appear unstyled. Their structure and functionality will remain intact.

We don’t include global styles or CSS files with the components. All styling is managed directly through Tailwind utility classes in the component markup.

## [](#_libraries_available_out_of_the_box)Libraries available out-of-the-box

-   [Magnolia React Component Library](cli-react-prototypes/)

-   [Magnolia Vue Component Library](cli-vue-prototypes/)

-   [Magnolia Angular Component Library](cli-angular-prototypes/)

-   [Magnolia Freemarker Component Library](cli-freemarker-prototypes/)


Each library offers reusable components and page prototypes.

You can use them as-is or build your own design system from them. For details and usage examples, select the desired component library above.

## [](#_customizing_or_creating_your_own_library)Customizing or creating your own library

You’re not restricted to the default libraries. You can create your own custom library:

-   Define custom templates and YAML definitions.

-   Use CLI-compatible placeholders and template logic.

-   Configure `mgnl.config.js` to point to your custom library.


For more details, see the [Creating custom prototypes](developing-prototypes/creating-custom-prototypes/) guide.

## [](#_why_use_the_library)Why use the library?
