# Integration

Magnolia is designed to be integrated with other systems. This allows you to take a best-of-breed approach and create the CMS/DXP platform that is best for your company. You can choose the tools that really work for you, integrate the systems you already have, and create a holistic UI that empowers your whole team, from developers to content authors and marketeers.

-   E-Commerce

## [](#_integration_points)Integration points

Magnolia can be integrated in various ways ranging from custom templates to full Java framework integration.

> **Tip:** The time required to perform an integration depends on each particular case but, generally speaking, any integration that can be done with light development is faster to implement than those requiring Java development.

### [](#_light_development_and_magnolia_cloud)Light development and Magnolia Cloud

Many [integration points](../../Developing/Integration/Integration-points/) can be implemented with [Light Development](../../Developing/Light-development-in-Magnolia/) and do not require Java development. This means that front-end developers can use them and that they are all available on [Magnolia Cloud](../../../../cloud/).

-   Apps and Actions (Including customizing the stock apps.)

-   REST API

-   Direct component rendering

-   Marketing Tags app

-   Templates and Frontend resources

-   Template models

-   Form processors

-   Groovy scripts


The integration points above can also be implemented with Java development.

### [](#_java_development)Java development

Additional [integration points](../../Developing/Integration/Integration-points/) are available with Java development, such as:

-   REST Client

-   Custom REST endpoint

-   Custom request filter

-   Custom servlet

-   Custom renderer

-   External Content (Content Connector)

-   Blossom: Spring Framework Integration

-   Direct rendering

-   Direct reading

-   Workflow customization
