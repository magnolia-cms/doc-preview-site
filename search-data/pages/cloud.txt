# Magnolia Cloud (Legacy)

[Magnolia Cloud](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/product/architecture-and-tech-stack/deployment.html) (Legacy) is an offering that provides:

-   Magnolia CMS optimized for running in the cloud.

-   A complete application development environment running on AWS.

-   Managed services for enterprise-grade security.


Magnolia offers two cloud bundle variants to suit the needs of our customers and partners:

-   *Standard* bundle variant focuses on speed and agility for your projects by leveraging Light Development. Your site is hosted in Magnolia Cloud; Magnolia manages the environment as a service.

-   *Custom* bundle variant is geared toward complex projects that need a high level of customization using both Light Development and Java custom modules.

## [](#_get_started)Get started

If you are new to Magnolia Cloud, we suggest you get familiar with the [cockpit user interface](Cockpit/), follow our simple [tutorial](Hello-Cloud/) or gain some deeper understanding into how we [manage domains and certificates](Onboarding-to-Magnolia-Cloud/Cloud-domains-and-certificates/) and what our [development workflows](Developing-for-Magnolia-in-the-cloud/) look like.

If you are a partner using a custom cloud bundle, we suggest you take a look at our best practices for [creating and deploying custom bundles](Developing-for-Magnolia-in-the-cloud/Creating-and-deploying-custom-cloud-bundles/) and get up to speed with what [monitoring and logging](Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Monitoring-and-logging/) information we provide.
