# Logs

The DX Cloud **Logs** section in the Cockpit displays logs for pods, domains, ingresses, and more. Each section has dedicated filtering by their relevant components as well as by a date range.

There are several different types of logs which are covered on this page. See the subsections below more for more details.

## [](#_enterprise_search_logs)Enterprise search logs

DX Cloud stores Enterprise search logs. You can access the logs by going to your Cockpit and navigating to the **Logs** section. Enterprise search logs store a range of information from application errors to slow queries.

Generally, we keep logs for **30 days**. However, for your deployment, you may configure a different duration.

> **Note:** You can select up to the last 7 days for this filter.

### [](#_instructions_8)Instructions

From **Logs > Enterprise search**:

1.  First, select your [desired cluster](#select-cluster-id).

2.  Select your desired **Release** from the dropdown list.

3.  Select your desired **Date range**.

4.  Click **Apply filters**.

    Filter selection persists

    When you **Apply filters**, the selection persists meaning if you reload the page, you’ll see the same filter selection.

    It also ensures you can share the selection and the recipient sees the same view as you do.

    Example

    ```none
    https://cockpit.magnolia-platform.com/logs/events?from=2026-03-06T16:25:31.842Z&to=2026-03-06T17:25:31.842Z& (1)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | In this case, it shows the filter for event logs for the last hour on the selected date. |

[1](#_footnoteref_1). Zones refer to CDN edge location codes representing geographic regions.

[2](#_footnoteref_2). A network performance metric that measures the time in milliseconds for a request to travel from the CDN edge to the origin server and back again.

[3](#_footnoteref_3). A network performance metric that measures the time in milliseconds for a request to travel from the Ingress to the backend service and back again.
