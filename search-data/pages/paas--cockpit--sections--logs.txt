# Logs

The DX Cloud **Logs** section in the Cockpit displays logs for pods, domains, ingresses, and more. Each section has dedicated filtering by their relevant components as well as by a date range.

There are several different types of logs which are covered on this page. See the subsections below more for more details.

## [](#select-cluster-id)Select desired cluster

Select your desired cluster from the dropdown menu at the top of the Cockpit.

![select cluster id](../../_images/select-cluster-id.jpg)

## [](#_magnolia_application_logs)Magnolia Application logs

Magnolia Application logs display log entries from Kubernetes Pods running your Magnolia application and database instances.

### [](#_key_information_tracked)Key information tracked

Magnolia Application logs capture operational events including:

-   **Application tier logs**: Java application events from Magnolia Author and Public instances

-   **Database tier logs**: PostgreSQL database operations and maintenance events

-   **Error and warning tracking**: Filter by log level (`FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`)

-   **Deployment topology**: Each log identifies its source namespace, pod, container, component, and tier


Generally, we keep logs for **30 days**. However, for your deployment, you may configure a different duration.

> **Note:** You can select up to the last 7 days for this filter.

### [](#_instructions)Instructions

In addition to the guidance here, there is embedded help available directly in the Cockpit.

    It also ensures you can share the selection and the recipient sees the same view as you do.

    Example

    ```none
    https://cockpit.magnolia-platform.com/logs/events?from=2026-03-06T16:25:31.842Z&to=2026-03-06T17:25:31.842Z& (1)
    ```

    | **1** | In this case, it shows the filter for event logs for the last hour on the selected date. |

## [](#_redirect_application_logs)Redirect Application logs

Redirect Application logs capture internal service events from your redirect server, providing visibility into the redirect service’s operational health and behavior. Use these logs to monitor service startup, troubleshoot configuration issues, track rule loading, and identify errors in redirect processing.

### [](#_key_information_tracked_4)Key information tracked

Redirect Application logs capture operational events including:

-   **Log severity**: Event level (`FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`) indicating the importance of each log entry

-   **Message content**: Details about redirect service operations, configuration loading, errors, or status updates

-   **Environment context**: Namespace and pod where the redirect service is running


Generally, we keep logs for **30 days**. However, for your deployment, you may configure a different duration.

> **Note:** You can select up to the last 7 days for this filter.

### [](#_instructions_9)Instructions

In addition to the guidance here, there is embedded help available directly in the Cockpit.

From **Logs > Redirect Application**:

1.  First, select your [desired cluster](#select-cluster-id).

2.  View the chart (histogram) to see redirect service log activity over time.

3.  In the Filters section, you can update the following:

    -   **Time range:** Date range picker to specify the period

    -   **Infrastructure:** Namespace and pod (limited to redirect service pods)

    -   **Log level:** `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, or `TRACE` severity levels

    -   **Message content:** Free-text search to find logs containing specific keywords or error messages



### [](#_details_table_6)Details table

You can view log details in the Log Details table. Click **Download logs (CSV)** to download the logs locally. To view a specific log, click the log in the table. This triggers a detailed view of the log.

| Column | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Date range** | The timestamp when the log entry was created, in local time format. | `Jan 14, 2026, 8:15:30 AM` |
| **Namespace** | The Kubernetes namespace where the redirect service is running. | `production` |
| **Pod** | The Kubernetes pod that generated the log entry. | `prod-redirect-server-0` |
| **Level** | The severity level of the log entry. | `INFO` |
| **Message** | The log message content, which may include status updates, configuration details, or error information. | `Redirect rules loaded successfully: 150 rules active` |

## [](#_redirect_request_logs)Redirect Request logs

Redirect Request logs capture HTTP requests processed by your redirect service, providing visibility into how URL redirections are being handled. Use these logs to analyze redirect traffic patterns, troubleshoot redirect rule issues, monitor response times, and identify misconfigured or missing redirects.

### [](#_key_information_tracked_5)Key information tracked

Redirect Request logs capture operational events including:

-   **Request details**: HTTP method, protocol, host, path, and client IP address for each incoming request

-   **Response metrics**: HTTP status code (`301`, `302`, etc.), response bytes, round-trip time (RTT), and request processing time

-   **Client information**: Original client IP (via `X-Forwarded-For` header), user agent, and request ID for distributed tracing

-   **Routing**: Backend service that handled the request

-   **Environment context**: Namespace and pod where the redirect service processed the request


Generally, we keep logs for **30 days**. However, for your deployment, you may configure a different duration.

> **Note:** You can select up to the last 7 days for this filter.

### [](#_instructions_10)Instructions

In addition to the guidance here, there is embedded help available directly in the Cockpit.

From **Logs > Redirect Requests**:

1.  First, select your [desired cluster](#select-cluster-id).

2.  View the chart (histogram) to see redirect request activity over time.

3.  In the Filters section, you can update the following:

    -   **Time range:** Date range picker to specify the period

    -   **Infrastructure:** Namespace and pod (limited to redirect service pods)

    -   **Request details:** Method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.), protocol (`HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2`), host, and path

    -   **Response:** HTTP status codes (e.g., `301`, `302`, `404`, `500`)

    -   **Client information:** IP address, `X-Forwarded-For` (original client IP), user agent, and request ID

    -   **Routing:** Backend service that handled the request

    -   **Performance thresholds:** Request time with comparison operators



### [](#_details_table_7)Details table

You can view log details in the Log Details table. Click **Download logs (CSV)** to download the logs locally. To view a specific log, click the log in the table. This triggers a detailed view of the log.

| **Date** | The timestamp when the redirect request was received, in local time format. | `Jan 14, 2026, 10:23:45 AM` |
| **Namespace** | The Kubernetes namespace where the redirect service processed the request. | `production` |
| **X-Forwarded-For** | The original client IP address when requests pass through proxies or load balancers. | `10.0.0.50` |
| **Backend** | The backend service that handled the redirect request. | `redirect-service` |
| **Request ID** | The unique identifier assigned to the request for distributed tracing and correlation. | `abc123-def456-ghi789` |
| **Host** | The hostname or domain that received the request. | `www.example.com` |
| **HTTP code** | The HTTP status code returned (typically 301, 302, 307, or 308 for redirects). | `301` |

## [](#_event_logs)Event logs

The **Events** section in the Cockpit displays information about the events within the cluster. These events are objects that show you exactly what is occurring inside your cluster, such as scheduler decisions or why some pods are being evicted from a node.

Generally, we keep logs for **30 days**. However, for your deployment, you may configure a different duration.

> **Note:** You can select up to the last 7 days for this filter.

### [](#_instructions_11)Instructions

From **Logs > Events**:

View from the Cockpit

![cluster events](../../_images/logs/cluster-events.jpg)

1.  First, select your [desired cluster](#select-cluster-id).

2.  Select the Start and End date range.

3.  If desired, enter a term to filter on.

4.  Click **Apply filters**.

    Filter selection persists

    When you **Apply filters**, the selection persists meaning if you reload the page, you’ll see the same filter selection.

    It also ensures you can share the selection and the recipient sees the same view as you do.
