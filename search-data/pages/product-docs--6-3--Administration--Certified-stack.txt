# Certified stack

The following software components have passed Magnolia’s certification testing for compatibility and performance with Magnolia DX Core and the Apache Jackrabbit Java Content Repository.

Unless specified otherwise, all currently supported or LTS releases can be used.

## [](#_operating_systems)Operating systems

-   Container-based environments

-   Linux

-   Windows

-   macOS


If you want to use any container-based implementation, use a base image based on JDK 17, as in the case of the latest version of the official Tomcat container ([`tomcat:9.0-jre17-temurin`](https://github.com/docker-library/tomcat/blob/master/9.0/jre17/temurin-noble/Dockerfile/)).

-   Ubuntu and Debian

-   Generally, Magnolia should work on any modern Linux distribution.


-   Windows Server and Windows 10


-   macOS


> **Note:** Are you running Magnolia on an OS that is not listed here? Let us know by posting to the Magnolia mailing lists.

## [](#_java)Java

Magnolia releases run on the current LTS Java version at the time of the first release.

| Java version | Magnolia |
| --- | --- |
| **Java 21 (LTS)** | Magnolia runs on Java 21 JVMs, but requires classes to be compiled at most with JDK 17, due to the version of the ASM library shipped with the product. |
| **Java 17 (LTS)** | The build base for Magnolia 6.3. |

### [](#_maven_coordinates)Maven coordinates

> **Note:** Magnolia 6.3 remains on the Jakarta EE 8 baseline. However, in preparation for a future Jakarta EE 9+ update, which will be breaking, the Maven coordinates of the EE 8 API specifications have been updated to the Jakarta EE Maven Coordinates.For more details, see BUILD-975: Replace Java EE8 modules with Jakarta EE8 modules.Example

## [](#_application_servers)Application servers

The tabs below show the application servers which we have certified (systematically tested per release) as well as those that are supported but not certified.

> **Note:** All application servers listed here fall under our SLA, meaning we support any issues you encounter with the application servers.

-   Supported and certified

-   Supported but not certified


-   Apache Tomcat

    We recommend you use the latest version of Tomcat 9.

    Check Apache’s [Apache Tomcat - Which Version Do I Want?](http://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html) page to find out about compatibility between Tomcat and Java versions.

    > **Caution:** For Debian 12, you need the latest version of Tomcat 9. Debian 12 comes with a Tomcat version that isn’t compatible with Magnolia 6.3 due to the Jakarta EE 8 baseline of Magnolia 6.3.


The following servers are not certified, only supported. We provide support for them if you use them, but we do not proactively test them for major or maintenance releases of Magnolia.

-   Wildfly 27 - 29 (Java 17)

-   Wildfly 30 and higher (Java 17, Java 21)

-   JBoss EAP 7.x

-   IBM WebSphere Application Server 9 and higher

-   IBM WebSphere Liberty 18.0.0.3 and higher


> **Caution:** IBM WebSphere is supported only with DX Core and with the special Magnolia package for IBM WebSphere.

## [](#_databases)Databases

-   External

-   Embedded


Unless otherwise noted, all vendor-supported database versions are supported for Magnolia.

-   MySQL `5.5` and later

    InnoDB storage engine for MySQL is supported by Magnolia, MyISAM is not. InnoDB is the default in MySQL 5.5 and later.

-   PostgreSQL

    See [PostgreSQL: Versioning support](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) for more details.

-   Oracle Database

-   Microsoft SQL Server


-   H2

    We don’t recommend using H2 for production environments.

-   Derby

    Apache Derby is only supported as an embedded database in a packaged version for low-volume use only.


> **Note:** Magnolia BOM manages versions of the embedded databases.

## [](#_cloud_providers)Cloud providers

You can deploy Magnolia on major cloud providers such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform and generally in any Kubernetes cluster.

## [](#_repositories)Repositories

-   Apache Jackrabbit (2.x series)


> **Note:** Magnolia BOM manages the version of the repository.

## [](#_browsers)Browsers

The Magnolia Admincentral and any Magnolia front-end (sites built with MTE) are compatible with major [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers) such as Chrome or Safari, released within the past two years.

> **Note:** We don’t proactively test Magnolia for use with the emerging browsers but we do our best effort to give support for them if you use them.

Admincentral UI is designed for desktop or small screens and tablets.

### [](#_safari_browser_and_application_pop_ups)Safari browser and application pop-ups

When exporting or downloading content from any Magnolia app, pop-ups that inform the user about the action are blocked by the Safari browser.

We’re actively working on improving this user experience. For more details and further progress, see [MGNLUI-9117](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9117) *Export action requires enabling pop-ups in Safari*.

Until the improvement is released, the Safari browser users must enable pop-ups. See [Apple Support: Allow or block pop-ups in Safari on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri40696/mac).
