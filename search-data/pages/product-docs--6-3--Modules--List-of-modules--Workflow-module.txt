Magnolia comes with a four-eye content approval workflow. You can reconfigure the default workflow to include more approval steps, more participants and decision points. Workflow is configured in the Workflow and Workflow jBPM modules. The workflow engine is based on the [JBPM Business Process Management](http://www.jboss.org/jbpm/) (BPM) Suite.

## [](#_modules)Modules

Magnolia’s workflow implementation consists of four modules.

![Four modules](../../../_images/workflow_modules.png)

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Workflow** | An engine-agnostic integration module. Enables the necessary integration points for Magnolia to communicate with a workflow engine. |
| **Workflow jBPM** | Magnolia’s jBPM integration module. Takes care of loading BPMN process definitions and workitem handlers. Implements the concepts of RuntimeManager and RuntimeEnvironment from jBPM 7. |
| **Drools JCR persistence** | Used for persisting work items and sessions to JCR. |
| **jBPM JCR persistence** | Used for persisting processes to JCR. |

The Kie modules are heavily inspired by jBPMs own JPA implementation.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.workflow</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-module-workflow</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.6</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.workflow</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-module-workflow-jbpm</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.6</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.workflow</groupId>
  <artifactId>drools-jcr-persistence</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.6</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.workflow</groupId>
  <artifactId>jbpm-jcr-persistence</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.6</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

> **Warning:** Be mindful of the version discrepancy between the Workflow modules and the core module.

### [](#_compatibility_module)Compatibility module

If you have custom code relying on classes from the *Magnolia 5 UI* Workflow module, you must do one of two things:

-   Update your code for the *Magnolia 6 UI* Workflow module.

-   Use the `magnolia-workflow-compatibility` module together with the `magnolia-core-compatibility` and `magnolia-diff-compatibility` modules.


## [](#_usage)Usage

See [Magnolia four-eye workflow](Magnolia-four-eye-workflow/).

> **Caution:** Workflows associated with unresolved tasks are kept in the workflows workspace. You should avoid deleting tasks directly in JCR to prevent orphaned workflows. Use either the Archive resolved tasks script or the Tasks cleaner module instead.
