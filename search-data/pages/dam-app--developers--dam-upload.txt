# DAM upload field

> **Caution:** This DAM upload field definition only makes sense in the context of the Magnolia Assets subapp. Don’t use it generically in any other context.

info.magnolia.dam.app.field.DamUploadFieldDefinition renders a field used by the Magnolia Assets subapp to upload assets to the `dam` workspace. It extends [`UploadFieldDefinition`](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Upload-field/) as follows:

-   The uploaded file is mapped to a media type based on its MIME type.

-   Default field labels are overridden by media-type labels such as **Upload new image**.

-   There are actions for [editing images](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Editing-images/) in the media editor and for previewing images.

-   There is a thumbnail preview.


It’s possible to configure `DamUploadFieldDefinition` in dialogs or other apps, but keep in mind that the file is placed in the workspace for which the field is configured. For example, if you use the field in a dialog for a component template, that file (when uploaded using the field) is stored in the `website`, not the `dam`, workspace. It’s best practice to keep your assets in the DAM whenever possible and link to them using a [link field](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Link-field/).

> **Tip:** Use info.magnolia.dam.app.field.factory.DamUploadFieldFactory for any custom implementation of the field. If no factory class is configured, the default field is rendered.
