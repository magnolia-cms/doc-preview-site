# Caching strategies

## [](#_overview)Overview

The cache subpage is about caching strategies in Magnolia, including policy configuration, compression to save bandwidth, setting a cache threshold, and cache flush events. Advanced cache modules introduce caching strategies such as eager re-caching and site-aware caching, which only caches content in the same subtree in JCR. High-performance caching modules focus on configuring the caching of dynamic and personalized content.

Tuning tips - Caching strategies

-   **Cache policies**

    -   Speed up your site by using compression to save bandwidth.

        For more, see [Compression](Cache-modules/#_compression).


-   **Advanced strategies**

    -   Use the `ServeUntilRecached` caching strategy where the cache isn’t completely cleaned. Instead, when content is updated, fresh cache entries are generated when the first page requests come in.

        For more, see [Serving old content while re-caching](Advanced-cache-modules/#_serving_old_content_while_re_caching).

    -   Enable eager re-caching to refresh the most frequently used pages as soon as an update is detected (Magnolia doesn’t wait for a page request before refreshing the cache).

        For more, see [Eager re-caching](Advanced-cache-modules/#_eager_re_caching).

    -   Configure multiple cache configurations to ensure that only cache entries belonging to the same subtree (site) as the published content are flushed.

        For more, see [Multisite cache configuration](Advanced-cache-modules/#_multisite_cache_configuration).


-   **Dynamic and personalized content**

    -   Improve performance by caching page variants and fragments of pages, especially for sites with a lot of dynamic and personalized content.

        For more, see [High performance caching modules](Advanced-cache-modules/#_personalized_content).


-   **Memcached implementation**

    -   You can significantly improve the rendering process performance by configuring this high-performance, distributed memory object caching system.

        For more, see [Cache modules](Cache-modules/#_cache_modules).
