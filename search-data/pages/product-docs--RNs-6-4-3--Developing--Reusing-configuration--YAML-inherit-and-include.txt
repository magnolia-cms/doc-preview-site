# YAML inherit and include

This page describes the Magnolia-specific directives `!inherit`,`!include` and `!override`. With these directives, you can reuse YAML file-based configurations. `!include` allows you to reuse an arbitrary resource, whereas `!inherit` is useful for extending a definition.

|  | Syntax | Requires version | Functions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deprecated syntax | `!include <path/to/a–ressource.yaml>` | Magnolia 5.4+ | [simple include](#_simple_include) |
| New syntax | `!include:<path/to/a–ressource.yaml>` | Magnolia 5.5.6+ | [simple include](#_simple_include) , [include and modify](#_include_and_modify_a_fragment) |

| Item definition type | Identifier type | Example identifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Template definitions](../../Templating/Template-definition/) | ID | `mtk2:components/link` |
| [Dialog definitions](../../Templating/Dialog-definition/) | ID | `mtk2:components/textImage` |
| [App definitions](../../../Apps/App-configuration/App-descriptor/) | Name | `definitions-app` |
| [Theme definitions](../../Templating/Theme/) | Name | `travel-demo-theme` |
| [Renderer definitions](../../Templating/Renderers/) | Name | `freemarker` |

## [](#_modifying_reused_configuration)Modifying reused configuration

Reused configuration originating from `!inherit` or `!include` (when using the new `!include` [syntax](#_syntactic_variants_of_the_directive)) can be modified. You can:

-   Add and modify properties originating from `!include` or `!inherit`. This will merge the included or inherited node with the modifications.

-   Use `!override` to completely ignore the properties of an inherited or included node. As a consequence, you have to add properties to the given node.


## [](#_yaml_override)YAML override

> **Important:** The !override directive ignores the properties of the node to which the directive has been applied. You have to specify all of the required properties of the overridden definition node.

### [](#_example_definitions_3)Example definitions

**A definition to inherit or include**

/module-a/templates/pages/l-page.yaml

```yml
title: L page
templateScript: /mtk2/templates/pages/basic.ftl
renderType: freemarker
dialog: module-a:pages/l-page
visible: true

areas:
  main:
    availableComponents:
      textImage:
        id: mtk2:components/textImage
      teaser:
        id: mtk2:components/teaser
      image:
        id: mtk2:components/image
      link:
        id: mtk2:components/link
```

**Inherit**

/module-a/templates/pages/xxl-page.yaml

```yml
!inherit:module-a:pages/l-page
title: XXL page
dialog: module-a:pages/xxl-page

areas:
  main:
    availableComponents:
      html:
        id: mtk2:components/html
```

The resulting definition merges the inherited definition and the modification’s area, rendering five available components in the `main` area.

**Inherit and override**

/module-a/templates/pages/xs-page.yaml

```yml
!inherit:module-a:pages/l-page
title: XS page
dialog: module-a:pages/xs-page

areas:
  main:
    availableComponents: !override
      link:
        id: mtk2:components/html
```

The resulting definition ignores all the properties of `availableComponents` in the inherited definition, rendering only one available component in the `main` area.

### [](#_overriding_list_items)Overriding list items

> **Tip:** Due to the syntax of a YAML list, you cannot apply !override to a list item. To bypass this constraint, use a YAML map instead of a list to apply !override to an item. Even if the definition class expects a list, the YAML file can define the item with a map.

#### [](#_example_definitions_4)Example definitions

**A definition to inherit or include**

/module-a/dialogs/pages/l-page.yaml

```yml
form:
  properties:
    title:
      $type: textField
      i18n: true
      label: title
    navigationTitle:
      $type: textField
      i18n: true
      label: navigation title
    windowTitle:
      $type: textField
      i18n: true
      label: window title
    keywords:
      $type: textField
      i18n: true
      label: keywords
      rows: 3
    description:
      $type: textField
      i18n: true
      label: description
      rows: 5
  layout:
    $type: tabbedLayout
    tabs:
      tabMain:
        fields:
          - name: title
          - name: navigationTitle
          - name: windowTitle
      tabMeta:
        fields:
          - name: keywords
          - name: description
```

**Include and override**

/module-a/dialogs/pages/xs-page.yaml

```yml
!include:/module-a/dialogs/pages/l-page.yaml
form:
  properties:
    title: !override
      required: true
      $type: richTextField
      label: Title ...
  layout:
    tabs: !override
      tabMain:
```

We apply `!override` to both `title` and `tabs` in the example definition above.

> **Important:** When overriding a bracketed list you must put the override directive between the key and list. An example is given below.Originalprotocol: [ 'http', 'https' ]Overrideprotocol: !override
> [ 'https' ]

### [](#_preserving_the_order_of_nodes)Preserving the order of nodes

The order of nodes as defined in a decoration via `!override` is preserved. This is useful especially if the only change needed to the existing configuration of nodes is their order. Previously, when providing a new configuration with `!override`, the configuration would be picked up by the system, but any change in the order of the nodes (at the level of the `!override`) would not be respected.

For example, the list view in the workbench of the Tours app may be adjusted with the following definition decoration placing the `path` column before the `name` column:

/stories-app/decorations/tours/apps/tours.yaml

```yaml
subApps:
  browser:
    workbench:
      contentViews:
        list:
          columns: !override
            path:
            name:
```
