# Manage DX Cloud

The **DX Cloud Cockpit** is the control center for your Magnolia deployment. From the Cockpit, you can manage different aspects of your deployment.

What can you do from the Cockpit?

All users

-   Use and configure your whole DX Cloud project with [Cockpit sections](sections/).

-   Manage your own [user profile](users/).


Administrators

-   Manage your [subscription’s users](sections/admin/) directly from the Cockpit.


## [](#_alerts)Alerts

DX Cloud alerts provide a closer look at the status of your cluster(s). If there is an active alert, you’ll see a notification in the top of your Cockpit.

![topbar alerts](_images/alerts/topbar_alerts.jpg)

There are three categories of alerts:

-   [Active alerts](#active-alerts)

-   [Pending alerts](#pending-alerts)

-   [Inactive alerts](#inactive-alerts)


### [](#_select_desired_cluster)Select desired cluster

Select your desired cluster from the dropdown menu at the top of the Cockpit.

### [](#active-alerts)Active alerts

As it sounds, active alerts are those alerts that are currently active for your cluster and should be seen to.

### [](#pending-alerts)Pending alerts

Pending alerts means that at least one time series returned by the evaluation engine is *Pending*.
