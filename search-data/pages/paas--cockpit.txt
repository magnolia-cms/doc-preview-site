# Manage DX Cloud

The **DX Cloud Cockpit** is the control center for your Magnolia deployment. From the Cockpit, you can manage different aspects of your deployment.

What can you do from the Cockpit?

All users

-   Use and configure your whole DX Cloud project with [Cockpit sections](sections/).

-   Manage your own [user profile](users/).


Administrators

-   Manage your [subscription’s users](sections/admin/) directly from the Cockpit.
