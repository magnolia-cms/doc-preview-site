## [](#_ldap_connector_module_november_12_2025)LDAP Connector module (November 12, 2025)

-   Current status: **Maintenance mode**


The [LDAP Connector module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/LDAP-Connector-module/) is in maintenance mode and has been replaced by Magnolia SSO. New projects should use the [SSO module](../../../../magnolia-sso/).

## [](#_external_dam_integration_framework_aws_s3_extension_november_12_2025)External DAM integration framework AWS S3 extension (November 12, 2025)

-   Current status: **Maintenance mode**


Starting with Magnolia 6.4, the [AWS S3 extension](../../../6.3/Modules/extensions-and-frameworks/external-dam-integration-framework/external-dam-s3-config/) in the External DAM integration framework is deprecated in favor of the DAM 6.0 external binary storage implementation provided by the `magnolia-dam-jcr-s3` module.

New projects should use the DAM module for storing binaries externally and keep asset metadata in JCR. See [magnolia-dam-jcr-s3](../../../../dam/developers/dam-jcr-s3/) for details. See [DAM module](../../../../dam/) for an overview of external binary storage.

The External DAM Integration Framework remains available, and the Bynder connector continues to be supported.
