# Analytics

We collect analytics (usage) data to:

-   enhance your experience by understanding how the CLI tool is being used,

-   prioritize further development of the plugins.


The data are collected **anonymously**. They are not tied to any personal information.

After running the first CLI command, the `analytics` property is generated in the `mgnl.config.js` file. The property may look like this:

```console
  analytics: {
    enabled: true, (1)
    uuid: "7b2dee82-d65f-4e1a-ac03-cad7ac2eeb1b" (2)
  },
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The `true` value indicates that the analytics is enabled. |
| **2** | The UUID version 4 of the project. |

## [](#_disabling)Disabling

To opt out of this CLI analytics feature, set the `analytics.enabled` property to `false` in the `mgnl.config.js` file in your project.

## [](#_data_collected)Data collected

If the CLI analytics is enabled and a CLI command is executed, we collect the following information:

-   **OS Architecture**: The architecture of your operating system (for example x64, arm64).

-   **OS Version**: The version of your operating system.

-   **OS Name**: The name of your operating system.

-   **UUID**: A unique identifier for analytics purposes.

-   **Node Version**: The version of the Node.js you are using.

-   **CLI Version**: The version of the `@magnolia/cli` package you are using.

-   **Command**: The name and version of the plugin command (plugin) that has been executed.
