# CDN and configuration

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) allow you to quickly deliver your site content by caching content appropriately for improved speed and performance.

> **Tip:** DX Cloud is a digital Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering and includes an out-of-the-box content delivery network.

CDNs are helpful because they can reduce video startup time by half, decrease download times for big data, ensure real-time updates for content, and improve user response times. Most importantly, they deliver content more efficiently to users globally by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.

The areas that CDNs address include:

-   Latency issues caused by, for example, geographical location

-   Reducing server load

-   Improving response times

-   Decreasing download times

-   Ensuring reliable and consistent content delivery


It is possible to [extend the publishing workflow](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Workflow-module/Creating-a-custom-workflow-process/) and add custom steps. Another step could be publishing to a CDN using the CDN’s API. Similarly, when unpublishing, you could remove content from there as well. Conversely, external systems can [trigger Magnolia commands](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Features/Integration/#_two_way_api_interaction_with_magnolia), such as publishing via the Magnolia API.
