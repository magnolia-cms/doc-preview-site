The Soft Locking module provides concurrent editing capabilities. Multiple editors can edit pages simultaneously and coordinate their activities within the authoring interface. Soft locking differs from JCR hard locking in that it stores information about who is editing content and this information is displayed as a warning to other users editing the same page. Whereas hard locking would prevent another user from editing the page, soft locking provides multiple-user access to content and facilitates efficient content contribution.

## [](#_working_together)Working together

The number of concurrent editors is displayed at the bottom of the page editor. Click the icon to see who is editing the same page.

![Tour preview with the number of users editing the page at the bottom](../../../_images/6-2_soft-locking_collaborating-users.png)

If users leave the page or new users start editing the page, the icon showing currently active users is updated accordingly. Additionally, notification messages are displayed in certain situations:

-   When another user saves their changes.

-   If the page is moved.

-   If the page is deleted.


> **Note:** When multiple people edit the same dialog simultaneously, the last change made by any editor overrides all previous changes. For example, Jane and Eric open a dialog to update page content, making changes concurrently. Jane is the last person to save changes, so her changes overwrite those from Eric.
