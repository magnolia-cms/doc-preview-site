# Tips and tricks to hack

This page is collection of hopefully useful tips and tricks to develop with different approaches and tools.

## [](#_filter_the_log_file)Filter the log file

The log file can be very helpful while developing - but it contains so much information that it might be too much. Often it makes sense to filter the log a bit.

# --line-buffered option makes grep work on a line-by-line basis
```
