# Magnolia Cloud update - September 2017

These changes are available in the latest update of Magnolia in the cloud.

## [](#_magnolia_core)Magnolia CORE

With this update you can use Magnolia CORE 5.5.6 when [setting up your environments](../../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Setting-up-a-new-environment/) in the cloud.

## [](#_additional_modules)Additional modules

We now [support](../../../Supported-modules-in-the-cloud/) the following additional Magnolia modules in our cloud offering:

-   [Content Editor module](../../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Editor-module/) – Produce simple interfaces for rich content. This module comes with the [Stories app](../../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Stories-app/), an example of a custom content editor that your authors can use to quickly create and publish flexible content in Magnolia.

-   [JavaScript Models module](../../../../javascript-models/) – Develop and use models written in JavaScript.

-   [Password Manager module](../../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Password-Manager-module/) – Store passwords in encrypted form and retrieve their plain text value programmatically. This module comes with the [Passwords app](../../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Passwords-app/), which centralizes the management of passwords.

-   [Synchronization module](../../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Synchronization-module/) – Synchronize a target Magnolia instance with a source instance and publish a large amount of content selectively.

-   [Messages App module](../../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Messages-App-module/) – Send messages to other users via Pulse.

-   [Virtual URI module](../../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Virtual-URI-module/) – Repackaged and updated functionality originally handled by the Virtual URI Manager.


## [](#_backup_frequency_changed)Backup frequency changed

Magnolia now automatically backs up the Live environment once every day, week and month.

Backups include both [content and configuration data](../../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Backing-up-and-restoring/).

In addition to these automated backups, you can [create manual backups](../../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Backing-up-and-restoring/Creating-a-backup-manually/). Only the most recent manual backup is stored.

## [](#_more_information_about_git_commits)More information about Git commits

During and after the installation of a development snapshot, the [Cockpit](../../../Cockpit/) provides more information about the associated Git commit, such as the committer’s name, commit message and commit date (if based on the latest commit) or tag name (if based on a tag):
