# Template scripts

[FreeMarker development only](../Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia)

A template script defines the output (typically HTML) and is interpreted by `Renderer`. The script is written in a templating language such as FreeMarker.

> **Tip:** See an overview of differences between FreeMarker and headless templating.

In the context of developing [single-page applications](../../../Features/Single-page-applications/), the elements comparable to FreeMarker template scripts are components. These are compiled into a single HTML page. On the Magnolia side, page rendering is handled by the [SPA renderer](../Renderers/#_spa_renderer).

A template script is a mixture of:

-   Static markup

-   Dynamically assigned values provided by `TemplatingFunctions` and other convenience helpers

-   Content references


## [](#_freemarker)FreeMarker

At Magnolia, we prefer [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) for its flexibility, clean syntax and practical error reporting.

Magnolia 7.0.0 includes FreeMarker version 2.3.33. You can use the `.version` special variable in a template to check this.

If you are not familiar with FreeMarker, these links will get you started:

-   [FreeMarker manual](https://freemarker.sourceforge.io/docs/index.html)

-   [FreeMarker quick start guide to templating](https://freemarker.sourceforge.io/docs/dgui_quickstart_template.html)

-   [FreeMarker built-ins](https://freemarker.sourceforge.io/docs/ref_builtins.html) are the `?` bits that follow expressions and provide useful functionality.

-   [FreeMarker directives](https://freemarker.sourceforge.io/docs/ref_directives.html)


> **Tip:** The Magnolia CLI offers the create-page and create-component commands that automatically create basic scripts, template definitions and dialog definitions.
