The **Siteimprove module** lets you perform SEO checks by using [Siteimprove](https://www.siteimprove.com/). It helps your site score higher rankings in search engines and checks how your content is performing overall.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../product-docs/7.0/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.seo</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-siteimprove</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### [](#_configuration)Configuration

The module provides the following configuration options.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mapperClass` | **optional**, *defaults to \`info.magnolia.connector.siteimprove.mapper.SiteDefinitionDomainMapper\`*<br><br>The default mapping implementation relies on the related site definition domain. You can add your custom implementation of the page mapping by implementing `info.magnolia.connector.siteimprove.mapper.SiteImproveMapper` and changing the related configuration. |
| `token` | **required** Token provided by Siteimprove. The first time Siteimprove is contacted the token is stored here. There is no need to set the token manually. |
| `username` | **required**, *if using prepublish check*<br><br>The username (email) used to log into Siteimprove dashboard |
| `apiKey` | **required**, *if using prepublish check*<br><br>To generate an api key for prepublish check visit Siteimprove dashboard → Integrations → API → API keys → Create API key ([Manage API keys](https://my2.siteimprove.com/Integrations/Api/ManageApiKeys)\]) |

### [](#_usage)Usage

#### [](#_accessing_the_siteimprove_dashboard)Accessing the Siteimprove dashboard

To access the Siteimprove dashboard for the first time:

1.  Log into Magnolia.

2.  Open a page in the Pages app.

3.  Click the Siteimprove icon ![Siteimprove icon](_images/siteimprove-icon.gif) to the right of the page.

    The Siteimprove dashboard then displays the SEO results for the page you have open (and site the page belongs to).

Once you have logged in for the first time, the Siteimprove dashboard remains available via the icon for each page you open.

> **Tip:** If the Siteimprove icon is greyed out, log out of Magnolia and back in again.

#### [](#_setting_your_website_to_be_observed)Setting your website to be observed

Before any SEO check can be performed, you must set your website to be observed by Siteimprove. You can do this in the [Siteimprove application](https://my2.siteimprove.com/Settings/Sites/Index) itself.
