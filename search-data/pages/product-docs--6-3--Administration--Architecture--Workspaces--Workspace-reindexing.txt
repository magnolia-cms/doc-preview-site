# Reindexing a workspace

Reindexing a workspace in Magnolia CMS rebuilds the search index to ensure content is searchable, typically after configuration changes or repository issues. Follow these steps to reindex a workspace.

> **Note:** This page describes the manual way of reindexing on a self-hosted instance. In DX Cloud, it can be done with the Delete indexes action in the Cockpit. For more information, see Delete indexes and workloads after restore.

## [](#_procedure)Procedure

1.  **Locate the workspace directory**

    Navigate to the workspace folder at `/<CATALINA_HOME>/webapps/<contextPath>/repositories/magnolia/workspaces/<workspace_name>`, where `<workspace_name>` is the specific workspace (`website`, `contacts`, and so on). Each workspace contains a `workspace.xml` file that configures indexing settings.

2.  **Create a full backup of the instance**

    Before reindexing, create a full backup of the instance. For more information about this, see [Backing up and restoring instances](../../../Instances/Backing-up-instances/).

3.  **Shut down the Magnolia instance**

4.  **Delete the `index` subfolder**

    -   Delete the `index` subfolder in the specific workspace directory (`/<CATALINA_HOME>/webapps/<contextPath>/repositories/magnolia/workspaces/<workspace_name>/index`).


5.  **Optional: Update indexing configuration**

    -   For more details, see [Search](../../../../../../performance-tuning/Search-and-indexing/Search-index-configuration-file/#_search) and [Custom configuration file](../../../../../../performance-tuning/Search-and-indexing/Search-index-configuration-file/#_custom_configuration_file).


6.  **Restart Magnolia**

    Start the Magnolia instance. The system automatically rebuilds the index for the workspace upon startup. Reindexing time depends on the amount of data in the workspace.

7.  **Check for errors**

    Monitor the startup process for errors. If the repository is corrupted, reindexing may fail, and you may need to address the underlying issues.


## [](#_additional_notes)Additional notes

-   The `onWorkspaceInconsistency` parameter

    If a workspace performs a re-indexing on startup and finds an inconsistency, the re-indexing process will fail.

    Add the `OnWorkspaceInconsistency` parameter in the `workspace.xml` file to prevent the failure. The process will just log the inconsistency.

    ```xml
    <param name="onWorkspaceInconsistency" value="log"/>
    ```

-   Ensure the Magnolia instance has sufficient resources, as reindexing large datasets can be resource-intensive.

-   For complex setups, contact and consult our [support:ROOT:index.adoc](#support:ROOT:index.adoc).
