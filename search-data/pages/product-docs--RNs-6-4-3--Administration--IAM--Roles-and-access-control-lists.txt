# Roles and access control lists

A role is a function a user performs either in the management of Magnolia or as a visitor of a Magnolia website. It reflects the actions and activities assigned to, required, or expected of a user. Specific permissions are granted to enable the functions of a role.

For example, the *editor* role is responsible for editing content displayed on the site. Permissions granted to this role allow the user to edit the content and submit it for review. The *publisher* role, on the other hand, is tasked with reviewing the content and publishing it from the author instance to the public instance(s).

Roles have JCR Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Web access permissions. For both the JCR content and Web access, you can define multiple ACLs per role.

Access to resources is controlled by the roles set up in the [Security app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/).

Roles are also used when configuring [App permissions](../App-permissions/).

> **Tip:** Select any role and click Role assignments in the action bar to view the users who have that role assigned to them.

| Workspace | Permission | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `website` | Read/Write | `/siteA/news` |

## [](#_web_access)Web access

In the **Web access** section at the bottom of the tab, you can define URL permissions for access to every Magnolia resource. One ACL grants access to a path for **Get**, **Get & Post**, or to **Deny** access. Typically, you need to at least deny the `anonymous` role access to AdminCentral.

On a public instance, deny the `anonymous` role access to AdminCentral and any members-only sections of the site.

To configure web access for a new user with an `editor` or `publisher` role:

1.  In the **Web access** section of the role, click **Add permission**.

2.  Create web access with **Get & Post** set to `/*`.

3.  Test the setup by logging out and logging in as the new user.


### [](#_site_aware_acls)Site-aware ACLs

DX Core allows you to manage multiple websites in a single Magnolia instance. You can control cross-site access in two ways:

-   Use the `<site>` parameter in the path to make an ACL site specific. See the `<demo-project>` example above.

-   The `CrossSiteSecurityFilter` grants or denies permission to a site when the site is requested through a particular domain name, preventing sibling site access.


See [Cross-site security](../../Security/Cross-site-security/) for a detailed discussion and configuration examples.

| Workspace | Permission | Path | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `website` | Read-only | `/siteA` |  |
|  | Read-only | `/siteA/news` |  |
|  | Read/Write | `/siteA/news/sports` | Longest pattern. Used to grant permission. |
|  | Deny | `/siteA/news/sports/NHL` | Even longer but not for the requested resource. |

| Workspace | What’s stored |
| --- | --- |
| `users` | Users (includes system, admin and public users) |
| `usergroups` | Groups |
| `userroles` | Roles and ACLs. Since ACLs are always attached to roles, they’re stored in the same workspace. |

| Scope | Path | Translated to a regular expression |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Selected | `/server/admin` | `/server/admin` |
| Sub pages | `/siteA` | `/siteA/*` |
| Selected and sub pages | `/siteA` | `/siteA` `/siteA/*` |

| Workspace | Permission | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `website` | Read/Write | `/news/sports` `/news/sports/*` |
|  | Read-only | `/news/sports$` |

## [](#_app_launcher_access)App launcher access

In order for users to access Magnolia via the app launcher, they need at least the **Get & Post** permissions to the root node (`/`**) in the \*Web access** section. This gives the user permission to access the system and launch [non-restricted apps](../App-permissions/), but without access to content.

> **Note:** In a multisite environment, the ACLs are site aware and the root node is then referenced with * (without the leading slash).

## [](#_partial_administrator_roles)Partial administrator roles

If you want to create a partial administrator role whose management permissions are limited to specific user, role, or group subfolders, you need to add read dialog permissions explicitly to such a partial role.

This is because, when restricting root access to permit modification of subfolders only, you are at the same time you preventing the Security app from obtaining the root level-provided UI artefacts that are meant to be available to the partial administrator role.
