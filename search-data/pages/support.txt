# Magnolia DX Core support

Need help with Magnolia?

-   If you have a support contract with Magnolia, you can enter support requests into the **[DX Core Support Portal](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10188)** in Jira, our issue tracking system.

-   If you don’t have a support contract, you can still get very valuable help from the [Mailing lists](#_mailing_lists).


## [](#_magnolia_account)Magnolia account

> **Important:** Due to security restrictions and certification requirements, we can’t create shared Atlassian accounts or allow their use. However, we’re happy to create two or more accounts for you if needed.

DX Core clients can use their personal Atlassian account to access the [Jira issue tracking system](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/jira/) and [Confluence wiki](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/wiki/home).

### [](#_access_to_gitlab_and_nexus)Access to GitLab and Nexus

-   For access to [Magnolia GitLab](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/), use the Magnolia Services (Robot) account via SSO.

    > **Note:** Access to Magnolia GitLab is limited to one account per customer or partner. This account should be a Magnolia Services (Robot) account.The Robot account must be enabled for GitLab access upon your request.Customers may then share access internally within their organization by generating tokens or uploading SSH keys for individual users.

-   To access the [Nexus repository](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/), use your personal Magnolia Services account via SSO.


If you don’t have an appropriate account yet, contact Magnolia Sales at [info@magnolia-cms.com](mailto:info@magnolia-cms.com) and include the following information:

-   **Name**: Give your personal name.

-   **Company**

-   **Client**: This is needed if you are working for a client who already has a contract with Magnolia.

-   **Email address**: Please provide a unique company email address. Personal email addresses should be used exclusively for individual Magnolia Services accounts. For robot accounts, a shared email address is acceptable. If the robot account is being requested for a partner’s shared email address, it must be unique for each cloud customer, using an example pattern `<cloud-customer-name>-robot@<partner–domain>.com`.

-   **Phone number**


> **Warning:** If you forget your password of your Magnolia Services account, send a message to support@magnolia-cms.com and ask for a password reset for this account.The Atlassian account password can be changed directly in JIRA/Confluence.

## [](#_reporting_issues)Reporting issues

Please provide as many details as possible when [reporting a SUPPORT-related issue](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10188) in the DX Core Support Portal. This allows us to help you more effectively. Please report how to reproduce the problem, attach log files, screenshots and so on.

Ticket’s SLA is set depending on the reporter of the ticket. New tickets created in need of a customer with a higher SLA have to be reported by the customer and share it to the involved accounts following the instructions defined in section [Sharing issues to teammates](#_sharing_issues_to_teammates). Sharing tickets will allow partners or teammates edit and comment on it.

### [](#_request_types)Request types

Select from the following issue types:

**DX Core Product**

-   **DX Core:** *Do you have issues with the foundation of the platform?* These modules comprise the standard functionality of Magnolia (e.g., Pages, Assets, Security). They are bundled with your standard license and require no additional installation.

-   **Extensions/integrations:** *Do you have issues with Magnolia Extensions or integrations?* These modules extend Magnolia to meet specific use cases, such as connecting to third-party tools (e.g., Commerce, DAM Integrations, Analytics, SSO). These are typically "unbundled" (installed separately).

-   **Installation and Migration:** *Installation or migration issues*. To request help with the initial installation of Magnolia or for help with migration of Magnolia to a newer version or different type of configuration.


**Professional Services**

-   **Customer driven development / Incubator modules:** *Experimental and Community-driven features*. These modules are developed by Magnolia Services or the community to test new ideas or integrations. Support Level is Provided “as is” with no SLA coverage. Support is not guaranteed and often relies on the community.

-   **Consultancy services:** *Expert guidance and hands-on help*. Select this if you are looking for architectural reviews, performance tuning, configuration assistance, or customised training for your team.


**Enterprise account support:**

Select this if you have questions regarding your contract, license keys, or user account permissions.

**Others**

If your request does not fit into the specific categories above, or if you are unsure where to direct your inquiry, please use this option. We will review your request and route it to the appropriate team (e.g., General Feedback, Documentation gaps, or Partner inquiries).

### [](#_betas_not_supported)Betas not supported

Beta versions of Magnolia are not supported. They are not official production releases or intended for production use. Please do not file support tickets for betas. Report and discuss problems on the [forum](https://groups.google.com/a/magnolia-cms.com/g/user-list) instead.

### [](#_exporting_configuration)Exporting configuration

When reporting an issue, the more information you provide, the better we can address your issue. Here’s how to collect information from your system.

There are several ways to export content, data and configuration. The most common is exporting XML.

To export to XML:

1.  Right-click a node to export the node and its children.

2.  Select **Export**. Accept any system requests to download files containing XML.

    The resulting XML file contains the node hierarchy. File name matches the path in the repository.


For example, when you export **Configuration** > `/modules/adminInterface/controls`, the file name is `config.modules.adminInterface.controls.xml`. When Magnolia Support imports the file it will recreate your node hierarchy in their Magnolia instance.

### [](#_tracing_errors)Tracing errors

Error messages tell you which Java class produces the error. This is vital information for finding the root cause of an issue.

The first task in tracing errors is to identify the fully-qualified name of the Java class.

**Example**: Magnolia was unable to send mail. The fully-qualified name of the Java class where the error was raised is `info.magnolia.module.form.processors.SendContactEMailProcessor`.

```sh
ERROR info.magnolia.module.form.processors.SendContactEMailProcessor
   07.10.2011 16:08:17 -- Contact email
   javax.mail.MessagingException:
   Could not connect to SMTP host: localhost, port: 25;
```

The class name is not always available. For example, in Freemarker templating errors only a stack trace is displayed, no class name.

```sh
freemarker.core.NonBooleanException: Error on line 13, column 6 in templating-kit/paragraphs/content/textImage.ftl
Expecting a boolean (true/false) expression here
Expression content.subtitle does not evaluate to true/false
it is an instance of freemarker.template.SimpleScalar
   at freemarker.core.Expression.isTrue(Expression.java:150)
   at freemarker.core.ConditionalBlock.accept(ConditionalBlock.java:77)
   at freemarker.core.Environment.visit(Environment.java:210)
   at freemarker.core.MixedContent.accept(MixedContent.java:92)
```

A [stack trace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace) is a sequence of nested functions called up to the point where the stack trace is generated. The error log displays the stack trace up to function where the failure occurred.

Errors are dealt with sequentially. Magnolia logs the error that first caused the failure. Rectifying the first error does not always solve the problem entirely but will help you to find the ultimate source. For example, if you try to send an email and there is both a templating error and an error in your SMTP configuration, you will first need to resolve the templating error before you can see that there is also an authentication issue.

Once you know class name, configure [logging](../product-docs/7.0/Administration/Monitoring/) to get more details.

### [](#_reporting_a_security_issue)Reporting a security issue

If you find a security vulnerability in Magnolia, please always report it in the **DX Core Support portal** :

-   [Create a SUPPORT ticket](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10188) or

-   Send an email to [support@magnolia-cms.com](mailto:support@magnolia-cms.com)


Issues in the SUPPORT project are private to Magnolia and the issue reporter.

Magnolia Support team will investigate and take appropriate action. Our goal is to keep the vulnerability private. We take security seriously and aim to provide patches promptly. The best way to stay secure is to always keep your Magnolia instances up-to-date.

### [](#_stale_issues)Stale issues

Issues where we have been waiting for feedback for a certain amount of time might get closed automatically. You’ll always have the option to reopen issues or create new ones even if they have been closed this way.

### [](#_following_up_on_your_issues)Following up on your issues

At any time, you can see the status of your issues by [DX Core Support Portal - Requests](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/user/requests).

Once a member of the Magnolia Support Team takes your request in charge, it will switch to the **In Progress** status. If we need more information from you, you will receive an email and the status will be **Waiting for customer information**. Your collaboration helps us follow up with your issue more effectively. Of course, you can always add comments or attachments when needed.

Once the issue is resolved for you, you can **Close** it immediately.

## [](#_reporting_via_jira)Reporting via Jira

> **Tip:** If you do not see the DX Core Support Portal, you do not have a support account. Support requests reported in other projects will be closed since they lack details about your configuration.

### [](#_sharing_issues_to_teammates)Sharing issues to teammates

By default, support issues are only visible to the reporter (you) and Magnolia Support staff. If you want to grant your teammates access to the issue, use the section **Share with** and type their account names. You need a DX Core support account in order to create and edit issues.

## [](#_forums)Forums

If you don’t have a Magnolia support contract and therefore no support account, you can still get some help from the community. Describe your issue on the [forum](https://groups.google.com/a/magnolia-cms.com/g/user-list), paste logs to a text storage service such as [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/) and link to them from your forum post. Don’t paste large amounts of text in the forum post itself.

There are several free [pastebin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) services designed specifically to store and share text online. For images, try [Tinypic](http://tinypic.com), [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or [any other](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_photo_sharing_websites).

## [](#_mailing_lists)Mailing lists

The mailing lists are fundamental parts of the Magnolia community. Magnolia mailing lists are available as Google Groups.

Subscribe to our lists or visit to see and ask new questions. Post your questions and they’ll be answered by members of the Magnolia community and staff.

-   [Magnolia Announcements Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/magnolia-cms.com/g/announce-list) for news and announcements.

-   [Magnolia User Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/magnolia-cms.com/g/user-list) for Magnolia users of all technical levels. Find help, help others and share your experiences.

-   [Magnolia Developers Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/magnolia-cms.com/g/dev-list) for developers to exchange information and keep up to date on development status. JIRA notifications are sent here, which makes this a very busy list.


## [](#_deprecation_policy)Deprecation policy

Technology evolves quickly. We want to take advantage of modern tools and practices in developing software at Magnolia. Deprecating old software is necessary to make room for innovation.

## [](#_deprecation)Deprecation

Deprecation means that we discourage the use of a feature, design or practice because it has been superseded or is no longer considered efficient or safe. Rather than removing features immediately we deprecate them to provide some backward compatibility and time for you to update your Magnolia projects. While the deprecated feature remains in the product for a while, we recommend that you replace it with current best practices. The deprecated status means we will remove the feature in the future.

## [](#_reasons_to_deprecate)Reasons to deprecate

We deprecate technology when:

-   The technology is obsolete or there are better, more modern ways to do the same thing.

-   We want to free up maintenance resources to do something that benefits the product more.

-   The technology poses a security threat. New, more secure ways are available.

-   Trends have passed the technology or it is considered old fashioned.


## [](#_process)Process

Deprecation is a gradual process. We announce it ahead of time in order to guarantee a stable product and to give you time to update your projects.

-   Maintenance mode

-   Deprecation

-   End of life


-   First, we move the feature, design or practice to maintenance mode. We announce this on the Magnolia forum and release notes.

-   We no longer develop the code actively. We don’t make any improvements or add any new features.

-   Maintenance mode typically lasts for 1 year.

    > **Warning:** Access to artifacts (bundles, webapps, modules) in maintenance mode requires an enterprise license. Your 6.2@product-docs:ROOT:page$Developing/Development-environment/Maven.adoc must provide access to the maintenance repositories.


-   Next, we deprecate the code. We announce this on the Magnolia forum and release notes.

-   In case of [API](../product-docs/7.0/Developing/API/), we mark the deprecation in code. Javadoc tells users in which version a method, class or interface was deprecated and what alternatives are available.

-   We only do security fixes. No more bug fixes.

-   We stop bundling the code with the product. You can still get the code from our Nexus repository but we don’t recommend using it anymore.

-   Deprecated status typically lasts for 1 year.


-   Finally, we remove the code permanently. In some cases, we move it to the Magnolia Forge, thereby donating it to the community.

-   We don’t do any maintenance, support or fixes.
