# Managing assets

## [](#_configuring_the_filename_field)Configuring the filename field

In the default configuration, the dialog does not have a field for renaming the filename of the asset.

You can add the field to the dialog by hotfixing the configuration of the dialog.

In the Resource Files app:

1.  Open the `/dam-app-jcr/dialogs/uploadAndEdit.yaml` configuration file for editing.

2.  In the `jcrDetail` part, add the `jcr:content:` property shown below to the intended position of the filename field, for example just below the media `upload` field property.

3.  Save the updated configuration.


```yml
form:
  properties:
    upload:
      factoryClass: info.magnolia.dam.app.field.factory.DamUploadFieldFactory
      class: info.magnolia.ui.editor.UploadViewDefinition
      required: true
      itemProvider:
        $type: jcrChildNodeProvider
        nodeName: jcr:content
        nodeType: mgnl:resource
    jcr:content:
      $type: compositeField
      itemProvider:
        $type: jcrChildNodeProvider
      properties:
        fileName:
          $type: textField
          label: ""
      label: Filename
```

Afterwards, to bring the modified configuration to life, open `/dam-app-core/apps/dam.yaml` for editing and save it without changes.

> **Note:** You can touch any decoration that is part of the Dam app so that the included file changes would be picked up.

In a similar way, you can also modify the configuration of the Asset (node) rename dialog (`/dam-app-jcr/dialogs/rename.yaml`) to enable the filename field there as well:
