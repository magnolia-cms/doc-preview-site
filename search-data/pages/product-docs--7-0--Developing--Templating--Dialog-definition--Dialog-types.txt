# Dialog types

> **Note:** These dialog types are part of the Magnolia 6 UI framework.

## [](#_simple_dialog)Simple dialog

Use a simple dialog to collect only few data points. A simple dialog provides limited ways to organize and group fields.

Characteristics:

-   No tab bar (the dialog is composed of one tab).

-   One or more fields.

## [](#_complex_dialog)Complex dialog

Use a complex dialog to collect larger amounts of data. A complex dialog can handle complex, hierarchical data sets and summarize key settings of some or all of its subforms.

Characteristics:

-   Multiple tabs for grouping fields.

-   One or more fields per tab.

## [](#_light_dialog)Light dialog

Use a light dialog as part of the task the user is working on. A light dialog asks for quick input but does not severely interrupt the user.

Characteristics:

-   Commonly used with actions that require parameters from the user.

-   Only makes sense in the context where the user is working.

-   Displayed modally but does not black out the background.

## [](#_strong_dialog)Strong dialog

Use a strong dialog to collect data from the user. A strong dialog severely interrupts the user because it typically requires more data to be input.

Characteristics:

-   Commonly used with more elaborate actions (such as uploading a file).

-   Displayed modally and blacks out the background.

## [](#_chooser_dialog)Chooser dialog

Use a chooser dialog to select an item from any [data source](../../../../Apps/App-configuration/Data-source-definition/) (for example, an asset to render an image or a page to tease). You can configure a [workbench](../../../../Apps/App-configuration/Workbench-definition/) with columns of your choice. Chooser dialogs also provide a default [search box](../../../../Administration/Configuring-search/#_configuring_in_app_search_filters).

To learn about chooser dialog properties, see info.magnolia.ui.chooser.definition.ChooserDefinition.
