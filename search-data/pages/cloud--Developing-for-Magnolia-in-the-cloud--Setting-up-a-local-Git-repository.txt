# Setting up a local Git repository

Every cloud-based Magnolia package is connected to a Git repository. You have to clone this repository to your local computer. The Git repository must contain a folder named `light-modules` - this is the place where you add new code for new features. You then promote your code to the remote repository to make it available in the cloud-based Magnolia package.

This page explains how to set up a local light module folder structure and synchronize your local folder structure with your Magnolia package using Git. You therefore need some working knowledge of using [Git](https://git-scm.com). If you are not familiar with Git, learn a few basic Git commands such as `clone`, `pull`, `add`, `commit` and `push`.

Have a look at the [prerequisites](../#_localdevprereqs) before you get started.

The Git commands we describe below are presented in command line use. You can, however, use an application providing a graphical user interface for Git usage such as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

> **Note:** We assume you are using one Git repository: the one connected to your Magnolia package. In a more advanced Git setup, you could use multiple Git repositories: one for development only and another one connected to Magnolia for deployment.

Log in to the Magnolia [cockpit](../../Cockpit/) to obtain the [URL of the Git repository](../../Cockpit/#_additional_information) connected to your Magnolia package. This information is in the **Additional information** section of the **Package overview**:

Open your shell, `cd` into a directory of your choice and clone the Magnolia repository. Use a directory that does not contain special characters or spaces within the complete absolute path:

```bash
cd ~/dev/repo/mgnl-cloud-packages
git clone https://<username>@git.magnolia-cms.com/scm/odc/magnolia-docs.git
```

The local repository is the location where you will hold your newly developed or updated code. It must create a `light-modules` directory to hold your work. For example:

```none
magnolia-docs/
└── light-modules/
    └── btk/
└── README.md
```

> **Note:** Both the Git URL (git.magnolia-cms.com/scm/odc/magnolia-docs.git) and the name of the directory (magnolia-docs) created as a result of the clone operation are just example names.
