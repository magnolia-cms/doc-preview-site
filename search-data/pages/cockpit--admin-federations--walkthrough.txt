# Federations deep dive

## [](#_add)Add

Add a Federation.

1.  Click on the "Add" button.

2.  Follow the embedded help.


## [](#_alias)Alias

The alias is used to identify the Federation in the system. This is the same as the Display name you enter when adding a Federation.

## [](#_type)Type

The type of the Federation. This is either OIDC or SAML.

## [](#_display_name)Display name

The Display name of the Federation. This is the same as the Alias you enter when adding a Federation.

## [](#_enabled)Enabled

The Enabled column indicates whether the Federation is enabled or not.

## [](#_cockpit)Cockpit

Cockpit mapping lets you automatically assign users to specific Cockpit groups based on identity information received from the Identity Provider (IdP) during login.

When a user logs in using a federated IdP (via SAML or OIDC), we inspect the user’s identity token for specific claims (such as `email`, `department`, or `role`) and matches them to defined rules. These mappings determine which Cockpit group the user should belong to.

Use Cockpit mappings to grant conditional access to environments, projects, or roles based on user attributes managed by your organization’s IdP.

For full details and instructions, see [Cockpit mappings](https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/paas/cockpit/sections/admin/#_cockpit_mappings).

After creating a Federation, you define these under the **Edit** option.

## [](#_rancher)Rancher

Rancher mappings let you automatically grant users access to specific Rancher environments based on identity information received from the Identity Provider (IdP) during login.

When a user logs in using a federated IdP (via SAML or OIDC), Magnolia inspects the user’s identity token for specific claims (such as `email`, `department`, or `role`). These mappings determine whether the user should be granted access to Rancher.

Use Rancher mappings to restrict or grant Kubernetes access based on organizational roles, departments, or other IdP-managed user attributes.

For full details and instructions, see [Rancher mappings](https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/paas/cockpit/sections/admin/#_rancher_mappings).

After creating a Federation, you define these under the **Edit** option.

## [](#_magnolia_sso)Magnolia SSO

Magnolia SSO mappings let you grant users access to specific Magnolia SSO clients and roles based on identity information received from the Identity Provider (IdP).

When a user logs in using a federated IdP (via SAML or OIDC), Magnolia inspects the user’s identity token for specific claims (e.g., `email`, `department`, `groups`) and uses these mappings to determine which SSO client and role the user should be assigned to.

Use Magnolia SSO mappings to manage access across Magnolia services and applications through centralized SSO group and role assignments.

For full details and instructions, see [Magnolia SSO mappings](https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/paas/cockpit/sections/admin/#_magnolia_sso_mappings).

After creating a Federation, you define these under the **Edit** option.

## [](#_user_attributes)User attributes

User attribute mappings let you populate user profile attributes in Magnolia based on values from the Identity Provider (IdP) token.

User attribute mappings are typically used to enrich Magnolia user profiles with data such as first name, last name, email, department, or any other identity-related field. This information can then be used for personalization, access control, or auditing within Magnolia.

Each mapping defines where the attribute value comes from, either from a claim in the IdP token or a hardcoded value, and maps it to a specific Magnolia user attribute.

For full details and instructions, see [User attribute mappings](https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/paas/cockpit/sections/admin/#_user_attribute_mappings).

After creating a Federation, you define these under the **Edit** option.

## [](#_details)Details

The details of the Federation.

Click the stacked lines ☰ to reveal more options such as the list below.

-   **Edit**: Edit the Federation including adding Cockpit, Rancher, Magnolia SSO, and User attribute mappings.

    For full details and instructions, see [Edit a Federation](https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/paas/cockpit/sections/admin/#_edit_a_federation).

-   **Delete**: Delete the Federation.

-   **Redirect info**: The redirect URL to the identity provider. The URL must be configured in the external identity provider. It tells the provider where to send the user after successful login.
