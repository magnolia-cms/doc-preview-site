## [](#_installing)Installing

This plugin comes pre-installed and ready to be used.

> **Warning:** You must install it manually for use in an already initialized project (containing the mgnl.config.js file).

| Form (short and long) | Description |

| `-m <version>` `--magnolia <version>` | Sets the Magnolia version for your project. By default, it uses the latest stable version. |
| `-s` `--snapshot` | Downloads the latest snapshot version of the webapp specified. |
| `-t <name>` `--template <name>` | Sets a template from the available project templates. |
| `-pt <source>` `--project-templates <source>` | Specifies the source location to load the project templates from. |

## [](#_extensions)Extensions

The *extensions* is a functionality in this plugin that allows developers to create a more interactive and automated project setup process, making it easier for the users to set up a new Magnolia project.

### [](#_extension_yaml_configuration_file)Extension YAML configuration file

The plugin searches for the `<rootdir>/extensions/extension.yaml` file in your project directory:

The file defines the additional prompts and post-command functions which can be helpful for tailoring the plugin’s functionality to specific requirements of your project.

#### [](#_file_structure)File structure

The YAML file typically contains the following key sections:

-   `extend`: Specifies a JavaScript file that the extension will tie into for additional logic or configuration.

-   `prompts`: A series of input prompts to gather the necessary information from the user. Each prompt can specify:

    -   `type`: The type of prompt, such as `input` for user text input.

    -   `name`: The internal name used to reference the data collected.

    -   `message`: The message displayed to the user during the prompt.

    -   `default`: The default value for the prompt, used if the user provides no input.


-   `commands`: Actions to be taken after the prompts have been completed, such as:

    -   `post`: Commands to be executed after the setup process. This could involve downloading the dependencies, setting up environment variables, and so on.



### [](#_example)Example

```yaml
extend: ./example.js
prompts:
  - type: input
    name: clientId
    message: Client ID
    default: clientId_001

  - type: input
    name: organizationId
    message: Organization Id
    default: organizationId_001

  - type: input
    name: siteId
    message: Site Id
    default: siteId_001

commands:
  post:
    - function: example
      retry: 3
      delay: 1000
```

### [](#_execution_flow)Execution flow

Upon project initialization, if an extension file is detected, the Jumpstart plugin executes the following steps:

1.  **Input Gathering**: It asks the user for input based on the `prompts` defined in the extension’s YAML file.

2.  **Configuration Integration**: The plugin retrieves the main `package.json` file. The responses gathered from the prompts are then added to this configuration object under the `answers` property.

    This augmented `package.json` object is then used to automatically populate the corresponding placeholders within your project files.

3.  **Post-Command Execution**: Each `post-command` function specified in the YAML file is executed. These functions have access to the `prompts` object, which contains the user’s responses, allowing the functions to perform tasks that are tailored to the user’s input.


### [](#_customization_example)Customization example

After gathering the inputs, a file with placeholders, for instance,

```javascript
// config.js

export default {
  clientId: <%=answers.siteId%>,
  organizationId: <%=answers.organizationId%>,
  siteId: <%=answers.siteId%>
};
```

is transformed into the following:

```javascript
// config.js

export default {
  clientId: clientId_001,
  organizationId: organizationId_001,
  siteId: siteId_001
};
```
