# Performance tuning guide

Magnolia 6.4

This guide brings together a wide range of topics so that you can make changes to your Magnolia setup to make it work as well as possible. Broadly, it covers the following areas:

-   **Performance**: Speed and efficiency.

-   **Scalability**: Accommodate increased workloads from a larger number of users or a greater amount of data.

-   **Usability**: When systems have a lot of things to process, sometimes it’s necessary to take a little extra time to ensure everything is done correctly. Providing appropriate feedback throughout the process keeps users informed about what’s happening and facilitates successful outcomes.

-   **Reliability**: Consistently provide correct results.
