# REST Design – Naming Conventions

Establishes consistent naming rules for resources, arrays, properties, and enum values while documenting deliberate deviations from Zalando’s snake\_case recommendations. The chapter aligns API naming with Java and JavaScript conventions to ensure consistency across backend and frontend systems.

## [](#120)**SHOULD** array names should be pluralized \[120\]

Adopted

Names of array properties must be pluralized to clearly indicate that they contain multiple elements.

Examples:

-   `items`

-   `orders`

-   `addresses`


**Reference:** [Zalando rule #120](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#120)

## [](#125)**SHOULD** represent enumerations as strings \[125\]

Adopted

Enumerations must be represented as strings in API payloads, not as integers or other types.

String enumerations are self-documenting and more robust against reordering or extension.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #125](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#125)

## [](#129)**MUST** lowercase words with hyphens \[129\]

Skipped

Rationale: Paths originating from Magnolia can be arbitrary and are not always under full control of the API design. Enforcing lowercase words with hyphens for all paths is therefore not feasible in this context.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #129](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#129)

## [](#134)**MUST** pluralize resource names \[134\]

Adopted

Resource names must be pluralized to represent collections of resources.

Examples:

-   `/orders`

-   `/customers`

-   `/products`


This ensures consistency and avoids ambiguity when working with collections and single resources.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #134](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#134)

## [](#240)**SHOULD** declare enum values using UPPER\_SNAKE\_CASE format \[240\]

Adopted

Enum values must be declared using `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. This makes enum values clearly distinguishable from other string values and aligns with common programming language conventions.

Examples:

-   `ACTIVE`

-   `IN_PROGRESS`

-   `PAYMENT_FAILED`


**Reference:** [Zalando rule #240](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#240)

## [](#118)**MUST** property name has to be snake\_case \[118\]

Skipped

Rationale: Magnolia aligns with Java and JavaScript conventions where `camelCase` is standard. This ensures consistency between backend DTOs and frontend models and avoids unnecessary mapping or transformation layers.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #118](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#118)

## [](#130)**MUST** use snake\_case (never camelCase) for query parameters \[130\]

Skipped

Rationale: Query parameter naming follows the same `camelCase` convention as properties to stay consistent with Java and JavaScript ecosystems and to reduce cognitive overhead for developers.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #130](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#130)

## [](#224)**MUST** follow naming convention for hostnames \[224\]

Skipped

Rationale: Hostname conventions are managed by Magnolia Cloud infrastructure. API designers do not define or manage hostnames as part of the API contract.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #224](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#224)

## [](#235)**SHOULD** name date/time properties using the "\_at" suffix \[235\]

Skipped

Rationale: Date and time properties follow `camelCase` naming conventions and established domain language instead of enforcing an `_at` suffix. This keeps API models aligned with existing Java and JavaScript naming standards.
