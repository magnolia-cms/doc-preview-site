# Combobox field

`ComboBoxFieldDefinition` renders a combobox where only one item can be selected (`comboBoxField`). The component has a text field where items can be filtered based on user input. `ComboBoxFieldDefinition` extends the [`AbstractSelectFieldDefinition`](../Select-field/) class.

> **Note:** The comboBoxField and listSelectField field types don’t support natural ordering. Instead, use the linkField with textInputallowed set to true as the better choice for ordering items alphabetically.For JSON data sources, use the JsonComboBoxFieldDefinition.

There is also `JsonComboBoxFieldDefinition` to be used with the [JSON data source](../../../../../../Modules/List-of-modules/REST-Client-module/JSON-data-source/) (`jsonComboBoxField`).

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `emptySelectionAllowed` | **optional** , *default is false* Defines whether the user can select nothing in the field. When `true` , an empty item appears to the user. |
| `emptySelectionCaption` | **optional** , *default is empty string* When `emptySelectionAllowed` is `true` , the empty item appears with the given caption. The value is [i18n](../../../../../../Administration/Language/Internationalization/#_i18n_message_keys) -able. |
| `pageLength` | **optional** , *default is 100* Sets the number of items in the field pop-up. The value must be between `1` and `100` . Otherwise, the property will fall back to the default value. |
| `placeholder` | **optional** Placeholder text to be displayed when the field is empty. The value is [i18n](../../../../../../Administration/Language/Internationalization/#_i18n_message_keys) -able. |
| `popWidth` | **optional** Sets the width of the field pop-up relative to the field itself. If no value is specified, the pop-up’s width will automatically expand to fit the content of all displayed items. |
| `scrollToSelectedItem` | **optional** , default is `false` Defines whether the selected item is always scrolled into view when the comboBox pop-up has multiple pages. Possible values are `true` and `false` . It’s useful for users who want automatic scrolling to the selected item, especially when the selected item is not shown in the pop-up’s first pages and the pop-up has several pages between which the user can scroll up and down. But be aware: setting `true` requires finding the item’s index, which can be expensive in many large lazy loading containers. |
| `textInputAllowed` | **optional** , *default is false* When `true` , the user can type into the field to filter available items. The `filteringMode` property of [select field](../Select-field/) defines how options are filtered. When `false` , the field just shows the current selection. |
