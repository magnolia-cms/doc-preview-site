# Migrating from older versions

For those coming from the older version of the module I would suggest that you uninstall that module before moving to 5.6.

1.  Delete the filter `/server/filters/cms/urltrans`.

2.  Change the class property of `/server/rendering/linkManagement`.

    Community and EE std

    `info.magnolia.link.LinkTransformerManager`

    Pro

    `info.magnolia.multisite.MultiSiteLinkTransformerManager`

3.  Change the class property of `/server/rendering/linkManagement/transformers/absolute`: `info.magnolia.link.AbsolutePathTransformer`

4.  Remove the module(s).
