# Configuration app

The Configuration app allows you to configure the Magnolia Web application, its modules and its apps. It displays the content of the `config` workspace in a tree and list view. Here you find configuration nodes that influence how the application behaves. The Configuration app is also used to define sites, templates, dialogs and everything else. The app is accessible at **Manage > Configuration**.

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

The Configuration app is installed by the UI Admincentral module (see [UI module structure](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/UI-module/#_module_structure)). The app has only a single subapp, which is `browser`. Permission to access the app is limited to users assigned the `superuser` role. The app is configured in `/modules/ui-admincentral/apps/configuration`.

> **Tip:** The Configuration app can be decorated.

### [](#_workspace)Workspace

The Configuration app operates on the `config` workspace.

### [](#_node_types)Node types

The Configuration app registers the `mgnl:contentnode` and `mgnl:content` [node types](../../../Administration/Architecture/Node-types/).
