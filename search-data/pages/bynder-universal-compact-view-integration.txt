# Bynder Universal Compact View integration module

[Digital asset management (DAM)](../product-docs/7.0/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) [Incubator](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/incubator/bynder-universal-compact-view-integration) [Tier 2](../incubator-modules/#experimental-features) Version 3.0.0 [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/7.0/) compatible

A Magnolia module providing the [Bynder Universal Compact View](https://support.bynder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013871360-Integrate-Universal-Compact-View) as the asset browsing and searching UI for a Magnolia link field.

## [](#_features)Features

### [](#_full_bynder_ui)Full Bynder UI

Search and filter by collections, tags, file format and more.

### [](#_magnolia_external_dam_integration)Magnolia External DAM integration

Only references are stored. Asset details are retrieved when pages are rendered internally or when Magnolia’s REST APIs are accessed.

### [](#_sso_integration)SSO Integration

Users with SSO access to Magnolia and Bynder can move seamlessly between the two systems and will see their user permissions respected in both.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Add the following to your [bundle](../product-docs/7.0/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.external.dam</groupId>
  <artifactId>bynder-universal-compact-view-integration</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## [](#_usage)Usage

To browse assets via a content editing dialog, use the new field type `bynderCompactViewField`.

To retrieve assets in REST APIs and DAM Functions helper libraries, configure Bynder access as per the [Bynder extension configuration](../product-docs/7.0/Modules/extensions-and-frameworks/external-dam-integration-framework/external-dam-bynder-config/).

Once the compact view is in use, it may be beneficial to block access to the Bynder subapp inside the DAM app. This can be achieved with a decoration as follows:

/MY-MODULE/decorations/dam-app-core/apps/dam.yaml

```yaml
subApps: !override
jcrBrowser:
jcrDetail:
```
