# Release notes for Magnolia CMS 6.3.19

[LTS release](../../../../support/) • Delivered on January 13, 2026 • Changelog: [22262](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=22262)

**Magnolia 6.3.19** is a maintenance release centered on enhancing search performance, system stability, and administrative efficiency. This update prioritizes optimizations to the underlying repository structure and resolves specific interface latencies to ensure a smoother experience for operators and developers.

The release optimizes indexing by offering lighter full-text search configurations and removing document merge limits, alongside a new configuration for trailing slashes in multisite setups. Notable fixes include resolving asset chooser latency, fixing H2 repository startup hangs on macOS, and correcting ordering inconsistencies in multi-link fields.

#### [](#_security_hardening_in_the_graphql_module)Security hardening in the GraphQL module

This release introduces query complexity analysis and depth limiting to the [GraphQL module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/GraphQL-module/), protecting instances against potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Existing queries continue to function with the new conservative default limits.

What’s new:

-   Query complexity limiting: By default, queries are limited to a maximum of `200` fields.

-   Query depth limiting: The maximum depth of a query is now `15` levels by default.

-   Field duplication detection: Duplicate fields in a query now count toward the complexity limit.


You can adjust these limits through the module’s configuration.

Additionally, client applications now receive more accurate HTTP response status codes, distinguishing between client-side and server-side errors. This change improves the debugging experience and aligns with REST/HTTP best practices.

| Scenario | HTTP code before | HTTP code now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ValidationError` (for example, `DuplicateDirectiveName`, `FieldUndefined`, `UnusedVariable`) | `500` | `400` |
| Query batching (JSON array format) | `500` | `400` |
| Malformed JSON in request body | `500` | `400` |
