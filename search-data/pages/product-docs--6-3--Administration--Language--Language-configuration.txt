# Language configuration

Magnolia CMS provides comprehensive multilanguage support for both the AdminCentral interface and website content. Key features include:

-   System language configuration

-   User interface language preferences

-   Multilanguage content creation and management

-   Content storage and URL strategies for localized content

-   UTF-8 support for international character sets


Language configuration operates at multiple levels, from individual user preferences to system-wide settings and site-specific configurations. Understanding these different aspects helps you implement an effective multilanguage strategy for your Magnolia projects.

## [](#_configure_system_languages)Configure system languages

Magnolia supports multiple system languages for the administration interface and other system components.

### [](#_available_system_languages)Available system languages

System languages are configured in **Configuration** > `/server/i18n/system`. Each locale has `language` and `country` properties that define the locale when combined. This allows you to define regional variations such as `zh-TW` for traditional Chinese or `pt-BR` for Brazilian Portuguese.

server:
  i18n:
    system:
      fallbackLanguage: en
      languages:
        en:
          country:
          enabled: true
          language: en
        pt:
          country:
          enabled: true
          language: pt
        pt\_BR:
          country: BR
          enabled: true
          language: pt
        zh\_CN:
          country: CN
          enabled: true
          language: zh
        zh\_TW:
          country: TW
          enabled: true
          language: zh

> **Note:** From Magnolia 6.2.4, both Java 8 and Java 7 locale IDs are supported in configuration.

### [](#_fallback_language)Fallback language

One language is designated as the *fallback* language. If no content is available in the target language, Magnolia displays content in the fallback language (`en` in the example above).

## [](#_configure_user_interface_language_preferences)Configure user interface language preferences

Magnolia allows users to set their preferred language for the user interface. This setting is stored in the user profile and applies to the AdminCentral interface.

### [](#_set_an_editors_language_preference)Set an editor’s language preference

To set a user’s language preference:

1.  Open the Security app (**Apps > Security**).

2.  Select the user profile you wish to edit.

3.  Click **Edit user**.

4.  Select a language from the **Language** dropdown.


Your browser does not support the video tag.

> **Note:** When the user signs in the next time, the UI is displayed in their preferred language.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | **optional** , *default is false* Enables support for localized content. Used to rewrite URIs and getting nodes based on the current language. |
| `class` | **required** Class that implements info.magnolia.cms.i18n.I18nContentSupport such as: • Implementations for a site organized into [a single tree](../Multilanguage-structure/#_single_tree) , in which the locale prefix usually points to the root of a site. • `info.magnolia.cms.i18n.IetfI18nContentSupport` . This is the default implementation, which supports [IETF BCP 47 language Tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) . Example `test: i18n: enabled: true class: info.magnolia.cms.i18n.IetfI18nContentSupport fallbackLocale: en defaultLocale: cs locales: cz: languageTag: cs-CZ enabled: true` • `info.magnolia.cms.i18n.DefaultI18nContentSupport` , which supports a language prefix such as `/en/*` in the URL and [stores localized content](#_storing_and_serving_localized_content) in a node using the naming pattern `<name>_<locale>` , for example `subtitle_en` . Use this implementation if your site is organized into [a single tree](../Multilanguage-structure/#_single_tree) , in which the locale prefix usually points to the root of a site. • `info.magnolia.cms.i18n.HierarchyBasedI18nContentSupport` , which stores and serves localized content in a hierarchical structure. Use this implementation if your site is organized into [multiple trees](../Multilanguage-structure/#_multiple_trees) , in which site roots are usually named after the locales. • `info.magnolia.cms.i18n.RequestLocaleAwareI18nContentSupport` , which reads the locale from the request. This implementation does not render language specific URLs. |
| `fallbackLocale` | **optional** , *default is en* Content is served for the fallback locale if content is not available for the current locale. |
| `defaultLocale` | **optional** If no locale can be determined, the default locale will be set. If no default locale is defined, the fallback locale is used. |
| `locales` | **required** |
| `<locale>` | **required** An arbitrary locale ID. For example, one that consists of language and country such as `zh-TW` for traditional Chinese or `pt-BR` for Brazilian Portuguese. |
| `country` | **optional** , for configurations using the `language` property Country code such as `BR` for Brazil. See [Java 8 locale IDs](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk8-jre8-suported-locales.html) . |
| `language` | **required** , unless a configuration with the `languageTag` property is used Language code such as `pt` for Portuguese. See [Java 8 locale IDs](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk8-jre8-suported-locales.html) . |
| `languageTag` | **required** , unless a configuration with the `language` property is used An [IETF BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) language tag. ** Available since Magnolia 6.2.45. | ** | Available since Magnolia 6.2.45. |
| ** | Available since Magnolia 6.2.45. |
| `enabled` | **optional** , *default is false* Enables the locale. |

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | **required** , *default is true* Enables multilanguage content storage and delivery. |
| `class` | **required** Class that implements info.magnolia.cms.i18n.I18nContentSupport such as: • `info.magnolia.cms.i18n.DefaultI18nContentSupport` supports multilanguage content for one site. • `info.magnolia.module.site.i18n.SiteI18nContentSupport` supports multilanguage content for many sites (DX Core). This class reads the available locales (languages) from the site definitions. |

## [](#_utf_8_character_encoding)UTF-8 character encoding

Magnolia supports UTF-8 character encoding for Unicode, enabling non-ASCII characters in page names and content.

To enable UTF-8 page names:

1.  For JBoss AS, add the following to `standalone.xml` or `domain.xml` after the `extensions` section:

    standalone.xml or domain.xml

    ```xml
    <system-properties>
            <property name="org.apache.catalina.connector.URI_ENCODING" value="UTF-8"/>
            <property name="org.apache.catalina.connector.USE_BODY_ENCODING_FOR_QUERY_STRING" value="true"/>
    </system-properties>
    ```

2.  Enable Unicode support in Magnolia:

    magnolia.properties

    ```none
    # Activate UTF-8 support to pages
    magnolia.utf8.enabled=true (1)
    ```

    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1** | This allows non-ASCII characters in node names. |

    > **Caution:** The value must be the same on both the author and public instance. Publication between instances with a different UTF-8 setting is not supported.


Sites built using Magnolia Templating Essentials templates declare UTF-8 encoding with:

```xml
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

**Example**: [Al Arabiya](http://www.alarabiya.net/), an Arabic-language site built with Magnolia, uses UTF-8 for right-to-left cursive script.
