## [](#_solutions)Solutions

This section provides solutions that should help resolve the issue in most cases.

### [](#_increase_device_size_for_cluster)Increase device size for cluster

You can increase the size of the device used by the cluster node in AWS.

1.  Use the cluster node value (instance label) to find the node and the device (device label) running out of space.

2.  Increase the device size in the AWS EC2 web interface or AWS command line.
