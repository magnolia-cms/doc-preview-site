# Internal linking best practices

Implementing internal links in Magnolia involves deciding how to resolve and handle links between nodes in the JCR repository. Each approach, `JcrNodeToPathConverter`, `JcrNodeToIdConverter`, or relying on the Magnolia core templating functions, offers unique advantages and trade offs depending on project requirements.

## [](#_jcrnodetopathconverter)JcrNodeToPathConverter

This utility converts a `javax.jcr.Node` to its absolute path in the JCR repository (for example, to `/path/to/node`).

Ideal for

-   Sites where content rarely changes location.

-   Simpler content structures with stable paths.


-   Pros

-   Cons


-   **Human-Readable Paths:** Paths are easily understood and debugged.

-   **Direct URI Resolution:** You can map the JCR path directly to a URL via URI mapping, making it ideal for sites with simple content structures.

-   **Consistency Across Environments:** If the repository structure remains the same across environments, paths can reliably resolve to the same content.


-   **Breakage Risk on Relocation:** Moving a node to a different path will break links unless URI mappings or redirection mechanisms are in place.

-   **Environment Dependency:** Absolute paths must match between environments (for example, `development`, `staging`, `production`), which can complicate deployments.

-   **Performance Impact:** Resolving content based on path might be slower in large repositories due to traversal.


## [](#_jcrnodetoidconverter)JcrNodeToIdConverter

Ideal for

-   Sites where content frequently moves or changes.

-   Complex repositories with dynamic content structures.


This utility converts a `javax.jcr.Node` to its unique identifier (UUID) in the JCR repository.

-   Pros

-   Cons


-   **Resilience to Relocation:** UUIDs remain consistent even if a node is moved or renamed, making them robust for linking content.

-   **Environment-Agnostic:** UUIDs are unique across the repository and don’t depend on the path, easing migration between environments.

-   **Performance Benefits:** Fetching a node by UUID is more efficient than resolving a path, especially in large repositories.


-   **Non-Human-Readable:** UUIDs aren’t intuitive for debugging or direct URI mapping.

-   **Mapping Overhead:** Requires additional logic to map the UUID back to a URL or content path for presentation.


## [](#_magnolia_core_templating_functions)Magnolia core templating functions

Magnolia’s core templating module provides built-in functions such as [Link functions](../../Templating/Template-scripts/Templating-functions/cmsfn/#_links) for resolving and generating links. These functions are part of the templating foundation, available by default in Magnolia.

Ideal for

-   Projects aligned with Magnolia’s standard templating approach.

-   Developers who prefer leveraging existing templating functions for internal link management.


-   Pros

-   Cons


-   **Convenience and Abstraction:** Simplifies link handling by providing ready-to-use functions for internal and external links.

-   **Consistency:** Ensures links adhere to the templating and content delivery rules of Magnolia.

-   **Ease of Use:** Reduces boilerplate code by relying on established patterns.


-   **Reduced Flexibility:** May not cover edge cases or custom requirements.

-   **Dependency on Core Templates**: If your project uses custom templates diverging from standard Magnolia practices, extending or overriding default behavior might require additional customization.


| Requirement | Preferred Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Stable paths, simple structure | `JcrNodeToPathConverter` |
| Dynamic content or relocations | `JcrNodeToIdConverter` |
| Large repositories, performance | `JcrNodeToIdConverter` |
| Core templating functionality | `Core Templating Functions` |
| Multilingual support | `Core Templating Functions (or custom logic with i18n)` |

## [](#_suggested_strategy)Suggested strategy

-   **Start with MTK:** For most standard projects using Magnolia’s templating system, MTK provides a robust and efficient approach.

-   **Switch to UUIDs if Necessary:** If your project requires dynamic structures or frequent node relocations, consider using JcrNodeToIdConverter for resilience.

-   **Use Paths for Simplicity:** For small, static sites or cases where debugging human-readable paths is critical, JcrNodeToPathConverter may suffice.


## [](#_additional_considerations)Additional considerations

-   **Environment Consistency:** Ensure UUIDs or paths align across environments to avoid breakage during deployment.

-   **SEO Implications:** Paths may be more SEO-friendly compared to UUID-based links. Consider how links will be rendered in the final output.


By balancing project requirements with these pros and cons, you can select the most appropriate approach for their use case.
