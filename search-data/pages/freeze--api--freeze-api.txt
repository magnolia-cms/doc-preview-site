# Freeze REST API

-   [Start or augment a global publication freeze](#_start_or_augment_a_global_publication_freeze)

-   [Stop or decrement a global publication freeze](#_stop_or_decrement_a_global_publication_freeze)

-   [Start or stop a global publication freeze](#_start_or_stop_a_global_publication_freeze)


## [](#_start_or_augment_a_global_publication_freeze)Start or augment a global publication freeze

Returns the status of the global publication freeze.

POST

`/.rest/freeze/v1/start`

Returns the status of the freeze request with:

-   `freezeState` - if a global freeze is currently in place, normally true, but may return false if an error occurred

-   `freezeCount` - the freeze count, the number of freeze requests currently active, should be 1 or more, will be 0 if an error occurred


Returns an HTTP status of: - `200` - the global publication freeze was started

> **Tip:** You can request more than one global publication freeze at the same time. This will increase the "freezeCount" result returned (see below). Multiple freeze requests can be stopped by:

-   the toggle command immediately stops all freeze requests

-   the stop command with the force parameter: immediately stops all freeze requests

-   the stop command will stop one freeze request, the same number of stop requests as start requests must be sent to stop a global publication freeze


| Parameter | Description | Type | Data type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `force` | *optional* , default is `false` . Stops any ongoing global publication freeze regardless of the number for freeze requests. | `query` | `boolean` |
