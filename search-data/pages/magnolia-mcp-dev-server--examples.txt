# Examples

This page walks through common developer workflows. Each example shows the prompt you give your AI assistant and the tools it calls behind the scenes.

### [](#_scaffold_a_new_magnolia_project)Scaffold a new Magnolia project

This example creates a new project from a template and starts it.

Prompt

```text
Create a new Magnolia project using the "magnolia-community-webapp" template
in the current directory.
```

What the AI assistant does

1.  Calls `mgnl_cli_search_templates` to find the matching template.

2.  Calls `mgnl_cli_jumpstart` with the selected template.

3.  Detects the project type with `mgnl_cli_detect_project`.


Result

A fully scaffolded Magnolia project ready for `mgnl start`.

### [](#_create_a_component_from_a_figma_design)Create a component from a Figma design

This example takes a Figma URL and generates a working Magnolia component with a FreeMarker template and dialog.

Prompt

```text
Create a Magnolia component from this Figma design:
https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123/my-designs?node-id=42:1
```

What the AI assistant does

1.  Calls `mgnl_figma_parse_url` to extract the file key and node ID.

2.  Calls `mgnl_figma_get_design_context` to get the component’s structure, styles, and text content.

3.  Calls `mgnl_cli_collect_generation_context` to gather project conventions.

4.  Generates a FreeMarker template (`.ftl`) and dialog YAML based on the design and project context.

5.  Calls `mgnl_cli_create_from_design` to scaffold, apply, and validate the component.


Result

A new component directory containing the template, dialog, and any required assets, validated against your running Magnolia instance.

### [](#_find_and_fix_a_rendering_error)Find and fix a rendering error

This example uses the log and API plugins to diagnose a broken template.

Prompt

```text
My "hero-banner" component is showing a FreeMarker error. Find the problem
and fix it.
```

What the AI assistant does

1.  Calls `mgnl_log_errors` to find recent ERROR entries related to FreeMarker.

2.  Calls `mgnl_api_get_template_definition` to inspect the template definition.

3.  Reads the `.ftl` file and identifies the issue (for example, a missing null check).

4.  Fixes the template source code.

5.  Calls `mgnl_api_validate_template` to confirm the fix renders without errors.


Result

The template renders correctly, and the error no longer appears in the logs.

### [](#_query_and_inspect_content)Query and inspect content

This example reads content from the JCR and inspects its structure.

Prompt

```text
Show me all "news" pages published in the last 30 days.
```

What the AI assistant does

1.  Calls `mgnl_api_check_connection` to verify the Magnolia instance is reachable.

2.  Calls `mgnl_api_query_content` with a JCR SQL2 query filtering by template and date.

3.  Returns a summary of the matching pages with their paths, titles, and publication dates.


Result

A list of news pages matching the criteria, ready for further inspection or editing.
