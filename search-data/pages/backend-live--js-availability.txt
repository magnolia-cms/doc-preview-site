# Backend Live - Javascript Availability

The **Javascript Availability** extension provides you with the ability to define your *own* Availability Rules that can be used across any definition that originally extends from `info.magnolia.ui.api.availability.ConfiguredAvailabilityRuleDefinition`. You just need to create a Javascript file that specifies the `isAvailableFor` function returning `true` or `false`.

## [](#_installing_to_a_bundle)Installing to a Bundle

If you have an existing bundle, perhaps obtained by using the Magnolia CLI, you will need to add the modules as defined at [Javascript Models 2.0](../../javascript-models/#_installing_to_a_bundle), as well as its dependencies to each webapp’s `/WEB-INF/lib` directories:

[Backend Live Availability JAR](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/service/local/repositories/magnolia.forge.releases/content/info/magnolia/backendlive/backend-live-availability/1.1.0/backend-live-availability-1.1.0.jar)

Using a standard Magnolia Bundle, these directories would be:

-   `apache-tomcat/webapps/magnoliaAuthor/WEB-INF/lib/`

-   `apache-tomcat/webapps/magnoliaPublic/WEB-INF/lib/`


## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

your-webapp-maven-project/pom.xml

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.backendlive</groupId>
  <artifactId>backend-live-availability</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
