## [](#_breaking_changes)Breaking changes

### [](#_restricted_access_over_non_https_by_default)Restricted access over non-HTTPS by default

This release changes a security-related default setting for the `secureCookie` property. For all non-HTTPS environments (except localhost), `secureCookie` must be set to `false` for users to log in successfully.

The CSRF `cookieSecure` property now follows the request protocol by default. Previously, the cookie was always marked as secure regardless of the request scheme, which caused browsers such as Safari to reject the cookie over HTTP. That led to breaking the CSRF mechanism when running locally or in non-HTTPS environments.

The `secureCookie` property now defaults to `not set`, meaning the cookie is marked secure only when the request is received over HTTPS. You can override this explicitly via the `secureCookie` property or the `magnolia.cookie.csrf.secure` configuration property. Additionally, the `sameSite` attribute now accepts `None` and `Omitted` as valid values, in addition to `Strict` (default) and `Lax`.

See [Security cookie attributes](../../Administration/Architecture/Request-processing-and-filters/Filters/#_csrfcookietokenfilter_and_csrfsessiontokenfilter).

## [](#_bug_fixes)Bug fixes

-   [MAGNOLIA-9713](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9713) Page links contain full JCR path if path contains special characters handled by siteHandler

-   [MAGNOLIA-9851](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9851) `LayeredResourceOrigin`: `listChildren()` inconsistent handling of mixed types and duplicates

-   [MAGNOLIA-9893](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9893) YAML definition reload detection uses mismatched clock sources causing intermittent failures

-   [MGNLDAM-2060](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-2060) DAM Azure Blob: Published images are deleted from Azure storage when edited

    > **Important:** This issue affects customers using DAM 5 or DAM 6 with binaries stored in Azure Blob or S3. When versioning is disabled in the DAM workspace and you change the binary of an asset (by editing it or uploading a new one), the system deletes the replaced binaries. This can remove binaries that public instances still reference.DAM 6.0.3 and fix this by stopping binary deletion entirely. A follow-up ticket (MGNLDAM-2048) addresses cleanup of unused binaries.

-   [MGNLEESOLR-276](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLEESOLR-276) MgnlContext is not set when reading assets from dam

-   [MGNLEESOLR-277](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLEESOLR-277) Magnolia instance does not shut down properly when Solr module is active

-   [MGNLREST-921](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLREST-921) `DefaultI18nContentSupport` does not support lang code with dash

    > **Note:** If your REST Delivery API endpoints serve localized content using dash-separated locale codes, this fix ensures correct locale resolution without requiring workarounds.For more details, see Changes in REST Delivery API and for migration information, see also lang parameter behavior in REST calls.

-   [MGNLUI-9303](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9303) Double-clicking a row in the Vaadin browser view often doesn’t work

-   [MGNLUI-9319](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9319) Switchable field: `jcrMultiLinkField` doesn’t clear within a form

-   [MGNLUI-9339](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9339) `jcrMultiLinkField` doesn’t work with `textInputAllowed: true` and `showOptions: false`

-   [MGNLUI-9348](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9348) Delete confirmation dialog not working for non content-type defined subapps
