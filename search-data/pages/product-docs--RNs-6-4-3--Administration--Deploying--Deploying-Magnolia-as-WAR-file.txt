## [](#_deploying_a_war_file_as_a_public_instance)Deploying a WAR file as a public instance

If you make no changes to the webapp before deployment, it will automatically be deployed as an author instance. If you change the name of the webapp to `magnoliaPublic` by for example renaming the WAR file to `magnoliaPublic.war`, it will be automatically deployed as a public instance. The name of the webapp folder determines the configuration that will be used. This is discussed in detail in [WAR file with multiple configurations](../WAR-file-with-multiple-configurations/).

If you are not familiar with these procedures, use a [standalone installation](../../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Installing-Magnolia/) that ships with an application server.
