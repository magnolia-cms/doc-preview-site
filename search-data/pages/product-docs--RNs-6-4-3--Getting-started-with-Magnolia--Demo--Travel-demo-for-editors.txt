# Travel Demo for editors

Use the Travel Demo to get an overview of content [authoring](../../../Authoring/) with a specific use case. This project illustrates how you can use pages and custom [apps](../../../Apps/) to manage your content.

Content is managed in the Magnolia Shell, our browser-based admin interface.

Log in as `eric` (password `eric`) the example Travel Demo editor.

| App | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pages | Every project contains a hierarchy (or tree) of website pages. In particular, check out the tree of pages under the `about` page. |
| Tour Categories | A custom content [app](../../../Apps/) used to manage the `destinations` and `tour-types` categories. This app is based on the [Categories app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Categories-app/) . |
| Tours | A custom content [app](../../../Apps/) to manage tours. |

## [](#_managing_content_in_a_content_app)Managing content in a content app

Content apps are useful for managing the *things* your site is about, such as tours, departments, affiliates, cars, etc. It is faster and easier to work in an app than in the page editor. In an app, there is only one dialog per item, and you do not have to worry about the page layout, or areas and components. Content apps encourage clean reuse of content across the site. The content is entered once in the content app and used in pages throughout the site.

### [](#_adding_tour_categories)Adding tour categories

1.  Open the Tour Categories app.

2.  Select the `tour-types` folder and click **Add category**.

3.  Fill in the fields, except **Importance** and **Related Categories**, as they are not used in the demo.

4.  Save.
