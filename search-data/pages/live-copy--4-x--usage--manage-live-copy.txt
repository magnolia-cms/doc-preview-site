# Manage live copy

## [](#_navigate_between_master_and_live_copy)Navigate between master and live copy

-   Jump from live copy to master page

-   View live copies from the master page


1.  Open the live copy page and click **Open master page** in the action bar.

    The master page opens in a new tab. To be able to see this action, make sure you *don’t* have a component selected in the page.


1.  To do so, select a master page in the app browser view.

2.  Click **Show linked live copy pages** in the action bar.

    A dialog opens listing the live copy or copies corresponding to the selected master. You can choose to **Open** them in tabs or **Show in browser** (they are highlighted in the browser).

## [](#_adding_pages)Adding pages

Newly created pages in the master aren’t automatically added to a live copy upon pushing master changes.

If you have added a new page to a master site, you must create a live copy of the new page so that its equivalent exists in the live copy site before you can push master changes to it.

If several live copies of a master exist, when you create a live copy of the subpage(s), you can choose where to locate the new subpage live copy. The live copy or copies are created in each location specified.

## [](#_manage_links_in_live_copy)Manage links in live copy

Typically, your master site contains links that are internal to the master site. The links in your newly created live copy site can point either to that master content or to the pages within the copy site you have created.

> **Tip:** Make sure the corresponding pages in the live copy exist so that the links can be relinked within the live copy.

When you choose to **Create live copy** of your site, the **Choose page location** dialog appears. An **Automatically relink** checkbox in the bottom left corner is checked by default. This means that all the links in your live copy site point to the content contained in live copy pages. If you uncheck the box, the live copy links go to the content that is on the master site.

![Automatically relink checkbox](../../_images/live-copy-automatically-relink.png)

If you uncheck the box, but later decide that you do want to redirect the links from the master content to the live copy, you can use the **Relink all pages to live copy pages**.

To do so, select the live copy site in the Pages app and click the **Relink all pages to live copy pages**.

![Relink all pages to live copy pages](../../_images/live-copy-relink-lc-pages.png)

In the **Relink all pages** popup that appears, you can disable updates from the master on components that are relinked. When the checkbox is ticked, this means that the relinked live copy pages are protected from being overwritten when new content is pushed from the master. The relinked components appear as locked in the live copy pages. For example:

![Lock content in the live copy pages](../../_images/live-copy-locked-link.png)

When you relink all pages, the links in the page properties (added using the **Page Properties** dialog) are relinked too.

> **Note:** If you copy a component from one page to another, remember that any associated links still point to the page it was linked to before the copy.

## [](#_protect_content_from_master_content_changes)Protect content from master content changes

Components within a live copy page are marked with an extra icon: ![Live copy component icon](../../_images/live-copy-linked-comp-icon.gif). This helps you to differentiate between live copy content and unlinked content.

You may not want all the content in your live copy pages to be overwritten when master changes are pushed. You can protect the content in whole pages, components or selected fields. This gives the local editors the flexibility to manage local content aligned with specific needs.

### [](#_full_pages)Full pages

To protect a full page, select the live copy page and click **Disable updates from master**. The page is marked with an unlinked icon in the Pages app browser: ![Unlinked icon](../../_images/live-copy-icon-unlinked.gif)

This breaks the link between the master and the live copy, but you can [reattach](#_breaking_and_reattaching) it if you need to.

### [](#_components)Components

To protect a component, edit the page, select the component, and click **Disable updates from master**.

The component bar changes to white and is marked with an unlinked icon:

![Locked component](../../_images/live-copy-locked-component.png)

> **Note:** When you disable updates from the master site, the component node is flagged with liveCopyReferenceDropped = true (visible to developers in the JCR Browser app) and the color of the component bar changes to white.When you only protect some fields within a component, the propertiesToIgnore flag is set in the array of field names (visible to developers in the JCR Browser app) and the color of the component bar remains green.

In the case of complex components with many fields within fields, note that all the nodes are protected when updates are disabled from the master.

For example, if a contact component has multiple fields and subfields as part of an address, the component node is locked and each individual field node is also locked to ensure they are not overwritten by content from the master:

-   `/live-copy/multi-page/contact/0` — The component itself

-   `/live-copy/multi-page/contact/0/multi0` — A complex field in the component

-   `/live-copy/multi-page/contact/0/multi0/address` — A subfield within the complex field


### [](#_fields_in_a_component)Fields in a component

To protect a field within a component, edit the component then click on the protect field icon next to the fields that should not be overwritten by your master content.

> **Note:** It is not possible to individually protect the inner fields of a composite field. For example, the single fields City and Country contained within the composite field depicted below cannot be protected individually. Only the composite field Location (with properties City and Country) is protected, as indicated by the red icon.

Likewise, the red icon in the screenshot below indicates that the field is *not* linked to the master content. It is protected. The grey and white icon indicates that the field is linked to the master content.

![image](../../_images/live-copy-locked-field.png)

When only one or some of the fields in a component are locked, the `propertiesToIgnore` flag is set in the array of field names (visible to developers in the [JCR Browser app](../../../../product-docs/6.3/Apps/List-of-apps/JCR-Browser-app/)) and the color of the component bar remains green.

For complex attributes, in addition to flagging the name of the attribute with `propertiesToIgnore`:

-   All child nodes are marked with the `liveCopyReferenceDropped` tag to ensure that they are not updated when pushing content from the master.

-   If the attribute uses the `currentItemProvider` [provider type](../../../../product-docs/6.3/Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/Item-providers/#_provider_types), all the attributes in the child components are added to the `propertiesToIgnore` array.


> **Note:** It is required to protect fields independently for every language defined. You can protect a field in one language and not another by switching the language and then clicking on the protect field icon.

> **Tip:** If a complex field is already protected from a version earlier than 3.2.10, you must unprotect it and then protect it again to enable the new code.

### [](#_breaking_and_reattaching)Breaking and reattaching

You can break the link between the master and the live copy pages.

The linking of live copy pages to master content is done using a page property called `masterContentIdentifier`.

> **Tip:** You can see this property in the JCR Browser or via content export.

To break this link:

1.  Select a page and click **Disable updates from master**.

    1.  After confirmation, the page no longer receives updates from the master page.



What just happened?

Breaking the link to master content is achieved through a page property called `liveCopyReferenceDropped`. When this flag is set to true, the linking of content is turned off.

However, the `masterContentIdentifier` still remains and the content can be re-linked at any time. To reattach the live copy content to the master content, click **Enable updates from master**.
