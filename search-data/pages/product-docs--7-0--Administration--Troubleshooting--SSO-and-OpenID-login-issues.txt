In your Tomcat configuration, make sure that the `CookieProcessor` component doesn’t have the `sameSiteCookies` property set to `strict`. Instead, set the property to `Lax`:

```xml
<CookieProcessor sameSiteCookies="Lax" />
```

This supports [OpenID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID) top-level redirects while maintaining decent protection against [Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) (CSRF).
