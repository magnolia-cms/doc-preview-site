# App descriptor

An app descriptor describes an app. The descriptor assigns the app a name, icon and implementation class. The name of the app content node must be unique as it is used to refer to the app across the system. This means you cannot name your own app `pages` since a [Pages app](../../List-of-apps/Pages-app/) already exists.

> **Note:** This app descriptor is part of the Magnolia 6 UI framework. The fully qualified class name is info.magnolia.ui.api.app.registry.ConfiguredAppDescriptor.

## [](#_example_descriptor)Example descriptor

```yml
icon: icon-app
class: info.magnolia.ui.api.app.registry.ConfiguredAppDescriptor
appClass: info.magnolia.ui.framework.app.BaseApp
label: Base App
subApps:
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `subApps` | **required** Node containing [subapps](../Subapp-descriptor/) . |
| `appClass` | **required** Fully qualified name of the class that contains the app business logic. The class must implement the info.magnolia.ui.api.app.App interface. |
| `name` | **optional** App name. If no value is specified, either the file name (without the suffix `.yaml` ) or the JCR node name will be used. |
| `class` | **optional** , *default is info.magnolia.ui.api.app.registry.ConfiguredAppDescriptor* App descriptor class that reads the configuration. The class must implement the info.magnolia.ui.api.app.AppDescriptor interface. Use the fully qualified class name. Another possible value is `info.magnolia.ui.contentapp.configuration.ContentAppDescriptor` . |
| `datasource` | **optional** Connects the app to a [data source](../Data-source-definition/) . For this to work, you have to use the `info.magnolia.ui.contentapp.configuration.ContentAppDescriptor` class. |
| `enabled` | **optional** , *default is true* When `false` , the app is disabled. |
| `icon` | **optional** CSS class that identifies an icon used for the app. See [How to add SVG icons for apps](../../Developing-an-app/Specific-aspects/How-to-add-SVG-icons-for-apps/) . |
| `label` | **optional** Text or [message bundle key](../../../Administration/Language/Internationalization/#_i18n_message_keys) displayed on the app icon in the app launcher. |
| `permissions` | **optional** Provisions the app to certain users. See [Permissions](#_permissions) . |
| `theme` | **optional** Name of a custom app theme. |

## [](#_permissions)Permissions

The permission to use an app is granted in the `permissions` configuration. The subnodes are roles. This allows you to provision the app to certain users in your organization.

In the following example, the app is provisioned to the `travel-demo-editor` and `travel-demo-publisher` roles. The property names (`editors` and `publishers`) are arbitrary—you can use any name you like. The value must be a valid [role name](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/IAM/Default-permissions/#_roles).

```yml
appClass: info.magnolia.ui.framework.app.BaseApp
class: info.magnolia.ui.api.app.registry.ConfiguredAppDescriptor
icon: icon-app
label: Base App
permissions:
  roles:
    editors: travel-demo-editor
    publishers: travel-demo-publisher
```

## [](#_app_descriptors_for_content_type_apps)App descriptors for content-type apps

In Magnolia, app descriptors can also be used to create apps based on Magnolia [Content Types](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Features/Content-Types/). For this, a special directive must be used in the YAML descriptor: `!content-type`.

There are several advantages to configuring an app this way. Such an app:

-   Always leverages a well-defined content type definition.

    Data of content type based apps can be accessed not only using [Delivery API](../../../../../rest/api/delivery-endpoint/), but also through [GraphQL API](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/API/GraphQL-API/).

-   Allows the editors to start entering content right away.

-   Usually has a very short descriptor and therefore needs less development time. There is no need to specify further app properties.

    > **Note:** You can, of course, tailor the app descriptor within the same file by adding additional configuration which will overwrite any configuration with the same name coming from the !content-type directive. Alternatively, you can create a decoration.Example extended configuration/my-tours-light-module/apps/tours.yaml!content-type:tour
    > label: tours.app.label
    > icon: icon-language-app
    > permissions:
    >   roles:
    >     - travel-demo-editor
    >     - travel-demo-publisher
    > subApps:
    >   browser:
    >     actions:
    >      addItem:
    >        appName: tours
    >      editItem:
    >        appName: tours
    >   detail:
    >     form:
    >       properties:
    >         name:
    >           i18n: true


### [](#_6_ui_content_type_directive)6 UI content-type directive

In Magnolia 7.0.x, the `!content-type` directive generates a *6 UI* app.

/my-tours-light-module/apps/tourGuides-app.yaml

```yml
!content-type:tourGuide
name: tourGuides-app
```

### [](#_5_ui_content_type_directive)5 UI content-type directive

If you needed to create a , you must use the `m5`\-marked variant of the directive.

/my-tours-light-module/apps/tourGuides-app.yaml

```yml
!content-type-m5:tourGuide
name: tourGuides-app
```

In this case, the app will be interpreted as a *5 UI* app and the app descriptor must be defined using the .

> **Important:** Even though you can still use apps built in the 5 UI framework in Magnolia 6.3.x, this framework has been deprecated.

| Content Type-Based Approach | The Vanilla Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Streamlines the app configuration file, yielding a shorter, more concise structure. Magnolia automatically provides essential app descriptor components, such as the [browser](../Subapp-descriptor/#_browser_descriptor) and [detail](../Subapp-descriptor/#_detail_descriptor) subapps, along with the [action](../Action-definition/) , [action bar](../Action-bar-definition/) , and [form](../../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Form-definition/) definitions. Developers can still override or extend these Magnolia-provided elements by modifying the app descriptor with explicit overrides or inheritance. | Requires a more detailed and verbose configuration process. Developers must possess a clear understanding of each component’s configuration requirements and their respective locations. However, this approach provides greater initial flexibility, enabling developers to manually define all aspects of the app without depending on a predefined content type definition. |
