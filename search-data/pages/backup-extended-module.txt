## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.backup</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-module-backup-extended</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.backup</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-module-backup-extended-ui</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `directory` | **optional** , `default ${magnolia.home}/backup/{epoch_second_count}` The file system directory where the backup can place files. If no directory is supplied the magnolia home directory is used. |
| `targetConfig` | **optional** , default `/backup-extended/target-confs/jackrabbit-bundle-h2-search.xml` The repository configuration file for the backup. This can be a file in a light module or a file reachable through an http address. The default is an H2 backup since this typically produces the quickest backups. |
| `comment` | **optional** , default `"Backup triggered through command."` A comment regarding the backup, such as, why and/or how it was created. |
| `repository` | **optional** , default `magnolia` The repository to be backed up. Typically this is the magnolia repository but backups could be made more efficient by splitting the repository into content and configuration repositories. With separate repositories they can be backed up separately at different rates and/or times. |
| `delay` | **optional** , default `10` seconds The delay is used when a backupDate is not supplied. Simply adds a slight delay before the backup executes. All backups end up as scheduled tasks. |
| `groupIds` | **optional** , default backup group A list of group Ids which can see and/or administer the backup from the pulse. In some cases users in these groups could abort the scheduled backup. |
| `backupDate` | **optional** , default current time ( `now` ) plus the delay A concrete date and time to initiate the backup. |
