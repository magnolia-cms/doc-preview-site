# CDN Request Logs deep dive

## [](#_log_chart)Log chart

The histogram visualizes your CDN request patterns over time, showing successful requests (green), client errors like 4xx (yellow), and server errors like 5xx (red). Click any bar to filter logs to that specific time period.

## [](#_filters)Filters

Use these filter controls to narrow down the logs you want to view. You can filter by status codes, time ranges, paths, and other request properties. Click the reset button to clear all active filters and return to viewing all logs.

## [](#_log_count)Log count

This displays the total number of log entries that match your currently applied filters. When logs are available, a download button appears here, allowing you to export the filtered results for further analysis.

## [](#_details_table)Details table

The table shows individual log entries with detailed information about each CDN request, including timestamp, HTTP method, path, status code, and response details. Click any row to open a detailed drawer with complete request and response information.
