## [](#_key_features_in_this_release)Key features in this release

### [](#_ai_capabilities)AI capabilities

The AI Accelerator for Magnolia 6.4 transforms your content strategy with advanced features built on a foundation of assisted content creation, AI-powered image editing, intelligent SEO optimization, and robust content classification tools. Discover the future of content management with:

-   **6.4 compatibility**: Added a [JS Field extensibility layer](../../../../ui-framework-javascript/) to enable 6.4 compatibility for the AI Accelerator module.

    [AIACC-258](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/AIACC-258)

-   **Smart image recognition**: Harness the power of any AI model for context-aware image tagging, enhancing searchability and relevance.

    The AI Accelerator extension integrates with the Image Recognition extension to automatically tag images using multimodal large language models (LLMs).

    ![Animation showing the process of generating tags for an asset](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/release-notes/ai-image-recognition.gif)

    This feature detects objects, concepts, and other relevant labels in supported formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG) and returns a configurable number of tags. By leveraging multimodal LLMs such as Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Anthropic Claude, it provides more context-aware and semantically rich tagging than traditional computer vision services.

    For more details, see [Image Recognition](../../../../image-recognition/).

    [IMGREC-139](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/IMGREC-139)

-   **Autogenerated asset metadata**: Effortlessly populate metadata for assets, saving time and boosting efficiency.

    The AI Accelerator extension enables you to generate asset metadata quickly. Specify which fields to generate: description, caption, title, and subject. You can trigger the action manually or run it in bulk across the Assets app using a script. It supports multiple languages with SEO-friendly output and works with any AI model you configure.

    ![Animation showing the process of generating a caption in English and German for an asset in the Assets app](../../../../ai-accelerator/4.0-alpha/_images/image-metadata-gen.gif)

    For more details, see [AI Accelerator](../../../../ai-accelerator/4.0-alpha/features/#_ai_generated_asset_metadata).

    [AIACC-271](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/AIACC-271)


### [](#_new_ui_forms_for_accessibility_and_extensibility)New UI Forms for accessibility and extensibility

New UI Forms replace Vaadin with a React-based UI, leveraging a custom design system for enhanced accessibility and developer extensibility. Key improvements include:

-   Better focus visibility, keyboard navigation, and interactive elements, meeting **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards and designed with **WCAG 2.2** in mind.

-   Available in content apps (not yet in the Page-editor apps). Existing form definitions do not require migration, with a graceful fallback to the old framework for unsupported complex custom fields.

    ![New UI Form example](../../_images/release-notes/newUiForms.png)

-   To help you migrate, use the new **Export filtered problems** action in the Definitions app. It exports all problems for all definitions based on the current filter settings.

-   To create custom fields, JavaScript fields (provided by the [JavaScript UI module](../../../../ui-framework-javascript/)) are the supported way to extend New UI Forms.

    [WARPFORM-5](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/WARPFORM-5)


For more details, see [New UI Forms](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/New-ui-forms/).

### [](#_global_search)Global Search

The *Find Bar*, as you know it from Magnolia 6.2 and 6.3, has been overhauled and replaced with *Global Search* for faster performance and better usability.

![Global Search in 6.4](../../_images/release-notes/globalSearch.png)

Main improvements:

-   Speed and Accessibility: Immediate results, support for external asset providers, and product information catalogs.

-   Enhanced Features: Persistent search results when navigating, improved filtering, sorting, and snippets showing search term locations for clarity.

-   Keyboard Shortcuts: Enable global search for improved navigation.

-   Global Search is integrated into CE/DX Core, its configuration moved to Periscope.

    [MGNLPER-283](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLPER-283)

    For more details, see [Global search](../../Authoring/Search/Global-search/).


### [](#_deletion_and_content_dependencies)Deletion and content dependencies

Deletion actions are enhanced with updated dialogs for mark-for-deletion, permanent delete, and dependency warnings, improving accessibility and usability.

![Mark for deletion, Permanently delete and View links dialogs](../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/release-notes/deletion-dialogs.png)

The new **View links** action in the action bar allows users to see related content and its publication state.

Both features are available for simple and four-eye workflows, compatible with Magnolia 6.4’s new UI.

[MGNLWORKFLOW-501](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLWORKFLOW-501), [MGNLCDEP-166](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLCDEP-166)

For more details, see [how to add the `viewLinks` action to your content app](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Dependencies-module/#_add_the_viewlinks_action_to_an_app) for developers, or [Deleting and restoring](../../Authoring/Deleting-and-restoring/) and [Managing content dependencies](../../Authoring/managing-content-dependencies/) for authors.

### [](#_page_editor_apps)Page-editor apps

The *Page-editor apps* extension brings the visual editing experience beyond the Pages app to your own custom apps. For example, you can create dedicated apps for channels like mobile apps or digital signage.

[PAGES-896](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PAGES-896)

For more details, see [Page-editor apps extension](../../../../page-editor-apps/).

### [](#_seamless_dam_external_binary_storage)Seamless DAM external binary storage

In Magnolia 6.4, you can store asset binaries in an external system while continuing to manage metadata in [Magnolia’s native DAM](../../../../dam/). This reduces JCR size, speeds up publishing, and improves search performance.

External storage is especially useful for projects with large volumes of assets or very large files, such as videos or high-resolution images.

![Overview of the DAM storage architecture](../../../../dam/_images/dam-archi-overview.png)

Additional details:

-   New binary management API: the `magnolia-dam-binary-api` submodule provides [interfaces for binary management](../../../../dam/developers/dam-api/#_asset_binary_management) without dependencies on other Magnolia modules.

-   Out-of-the-box support for [storing binary data in AWS S3](../../../../dam/developers/dam-jcr-s3/).

-   Implement a custom external storage provider by following the [custom implementation guide](../../../../dam/developers/custom-implementation/).

-   Migration scripts are available: [Migrate from DAM 4 JCR-based storage to DAM 6](../../../../dam/migrate/migrate-jcr-to-dam/).

-   Successor to the [Hybrid Assets incubator](#hybrid-assets:ROOT:index.adoc) ([migration scripts provided](../../../../dam/migrate/migrate-HA-to-dam/)) and the [External DAM Integration Framework S3 extension](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Modules/extensions-and-frameworks/external-dam-integration-framework/), which now enters maintenance mode.

-   Version information:

    -   DAM 5.0: Opt-in for Magnolia 6.3. Default is still DAM 4.x.

    -   DAM 6.0: Default for Magnolia 6.4. Follows the 6.4 lifecycle. Functionality is otherwise nearly identical between 5.0 and 6.0.



[MGNLDAM-1865](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-1865)

### [](#_image_focal_extension)Image Focal extension

The [Image Focal extension](../../../../image-focal/), previously a popular incubator, is now a fully maintained product extension:

-   Allows authors to select points of interest in images for dynamic rendering across formats.

-   Ensures no regression in functionality, ease of adoption, and compatibility with external binaries such AWS S3.


[MGNLDAM-1807](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-1807)

### [](#_animated_gif_support)Animated GIF support

Animated GIFs are supported natively in Magnolia with the Imaging module.

[MGNLIMG-428](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLIMG-428)

### [](#_asset_getcontentstream_deprecated)`Asset.getContentStream()` deprecated

Instead of `Asset.getContentStream()`, developers should use `BinaryManagementRead#streamContent(BinaryReference)` from `info.magnolia.dam.binary.api`. The `streamContent` handles retrieving the actual binary data, abstracting away the underlying storage provider (like S3).

For more details, see [DAM API](../../../../dam/developers/dam-api/).

### [](#_image_recognition_class_changes)Image recognition class changes

The `ImageRecogniser.recognise` method signature changes from `byte[]` to `ImageBinary`.

[Custom implementations](../../../../image-recognition/developers/configure/#_using_other_image_recognition_solutions) of the `ImageRecogniser` interface will fail to compile or run unless updated to use the new `ImageBinary` parameter.

### [](#_automatic_license_retrieval_and_monitoring)Automatic license retrieval and monitoring

Two additions make working with DX Core licenses simpler and safer:

-   Automatic license key retrieval at startup.

    From this release onwards, Magnolia automatically retrieves a license key at startup by checking multiple sources. For more details, see [Updating a license key](../../Administration/License/#_updating_a_license_key). You should use [`magnolia.license.location`](../../Administration/Architecture/Configuration-management/#magnolia-license-location) for more security if required in your environment.

-   Live monitoring of license files.

    Both the `magnolia.license.location` target and the default `${magnolia.home}/license.key` are monitored for changes. Automatic file monitoring refreshes the license without you having to use the UI or restart the application, making it suitable for secret rotation and automated deployments.


For more details, see [License](../../Administration/License/).

Some licensing code is deprecated or removed for maintainability:

-   Two `info.magnolia.license.LicenseConsts` constants are replaced.

-   In `info.magnolia.license.LicenseManager`, a constructor and a method for fetching license statuses are removed.

-   Several obsolete functions in `info.magnolia.license.LicenseStatus` are deprecated without replacement.


[MGNLLIC-124](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLLIC-124)

[MGNLLIC-123](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLLIC-123).

### [](#_vaadin_ui_usability_and_accessibility_improvements)Vaadin UI usability and accessibility improvements

Vaadin UI enhancements to improve usability and accessibility, such as navigation to edit forms, improved keyboard focus visibility, including on Safari.

[MGNLUI-9080](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-9080)

### [](#_swift_publication_for_faster_content_delivery)Swift Publication for faster content delivery

Swift Publication introduces a faster, more reliable way to publish large volumes of content:

-   External Versioning in S3 or OBS, which provides a loose coupling for managing versions.

-   Asynchronous publication allows users to continue working in the UI during publication because it no longer has to wait for public instance replies.

    ![Swift architecture](../../_images/swift/SwiftPublication-REST.png)

-   Improved ciphering and the option to skip it in secure environments.


Performance improvements reduce publishing time by **70%** for large (420 pages) and massive (5,000 pages) publications.

For more details, see [Swift publication](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Swift-publication/).

[SWIFTPUB-364](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/SWIFTPUB-364)

### [](#_magnolia_package_manager)Magnolia Package Manager

The Magnolia Package Manager, a new content app built with the [Magnolia Design System](https://ds.magnolia-cloud.com), enables smart export and import of content at scale. Magnolia Package Manager is commonly used for:

-   Transferring packaged content between environments


![Package Manager app in 6.4](../../../../package-manager/_images/package-manager-app.png)

To move content quickly and conveniently from one environment to another, you can use the Package Manager. It’s designed to handle gigabytes of data reliably and prevent long waiting times by allowing direct installation on public instances, bypassing standard publication flow.

For more details, see [Package manager](../../../../package-manager/).

### [](#_variant_preview_on_public_instances)Variant preview on public instances

It is no longer possible to preview content variants on public instances. When a public user tries to access a variant, they see the original page with no variants applied.

-   The variant preview option is always `false` and read-only for public users, preventing any accidental content leaks.

-   Authors retain full access, with variant preview remaining `true` for them.


This change ensures consistent content security while maintaining full variant functionality for content authors.

[MGNLPN-818](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLPN-818)
