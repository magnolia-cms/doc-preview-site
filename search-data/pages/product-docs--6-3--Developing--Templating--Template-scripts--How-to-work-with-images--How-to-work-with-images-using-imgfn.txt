# How to work with images using imgfn

[FreeMarker development only](../../../Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia)

This page explains how to work with images using [`imgfn`](../../Templating-functions/imgfn/) [templating functions](../../Templating-functions/) in template scripts. With `imgfn` you can get an image from any JCR workspace.

If you manage your images with the Magnolia [Digital Asset Management module](../../../../../../../dam/developers/install/), we recommend using `damfn`. For more information, see [working with images using `damfn`](../How-to-work-with-images-using-damfn/).

## [](#_uploading_the_image_with_a_basic_upload_field)Uploading the image with a basic upload field

With a [basic upload field](#6.2@Support/Magnolia-5-UI-documentation/Dialog-definition-5-UI/Field-definition-5-UI/List-of-fields-5-UI/Basic-upload-field-5-UI.adoc) you can upload an image directly to the node of your context. When saving the data of the dialog, Magnolia creates a subnode of the node of your context and stores the binary data of the image as property of the subnode.

-   If the dialog is for a [Component](../../../Template-definition/Component-definition/), the system creates a subnode of the component node.

-   If the dialog is for a an item of a [content app](../../../../../Apps/#_what_is_an_app), the system creates a subnode of the content item node.


Example - code fragment from a [dialog definition](../../../Dialog-definition/)

```js
Form:
  tabs:
    - name: tabImage
      fields:
        - name: image
          class: info.magnolia.ui.form.field.definition.BasicUploadFieldDefinition
          binaryNodeName: myNode
```

In the dialog definition, you can define the value of the `binaryNodeName` property (in the example the value is `myNode`). Keep in mind that you must know the name of this subnode to render the image later on.

You can check the JCR node structure in in the [JCR Browser app](../../../../../Apps/List-of-apps/JCR-Browser-app/).

## [](#_displaying_an_image_variation_using_imgfn)Displaying an image variation using imgfn

Using `imgfn`, you can create a link to an image stored in any workspace as long as you know the path to the node which stores the binary data of the image.

Look at the screenshot above showing the JCR browser. It highlights the subnode of a component node. Within the rendering context of a component template script you have the [`content`](../../Rendering-context-objects/#_content) object which is the component node. In the screenshot above, the node with the name `0` is the content object.

To display an image, you must get the subnode of `content` and pass it as argument to the `imgfn` templating function. You can use the same method to get the original version of the image and to get a variation.

```numberLines
[#assign binaryNode = cmsfn.asJCRNode(content).getNode('myNode') /]
[#assign imgLink = imgfn.getImageVariationLinkFromBinary(binaryNode,'original') /]
[#assign imgLink240 = imgfn.getImageVariationLinkFromBinary(binaryNode,'240') /]

<div>
    <span>The default image</span><br/>
    <img src="${imgLink}"><br/>
    <span>Image variation 240</span><br/>
    <img src="${imgLink240}">
</div>
```

-   Line: Get the subnode which contains the binary data. You need to know the subnode name, `myNode` in the example.

-   Line 2, 3: Create a link to the image. Use `original` to get the original size of the uploaded image.

-   Line 2, 3: Create a link to the image. Use `240` to get a link to an image variation named *240.*

    -   Make sure the [image variation](../../../Theme/#_image_variations) you want to use is configured in your site [theme](../../../Theme/). Each variation should be a node under `<my-theme>/imaging/variations`.
