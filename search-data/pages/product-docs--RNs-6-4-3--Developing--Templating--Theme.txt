# Theme

A theme is a collection of resource files that gives a site its visual identity through the use of colors and typography. A theme consists of cascading style sheets (CSS), JavaScript files and an imaging configuration that tells the [Imaging module](../../../../../imaging/) what to do with images for a particular page or component.

## [](#_what_is_a_theme)What is a theme?

A theme is a module or part of a module composed of CSS, JS and images.

## [](#_when_to_use_a_theme)When to use a theme

The [Site module](../../../../../site/) provides theme functionality. You can only create a theme if you use this module and have configured a [site definition](../Site-definition/).

## [](#_themes_and_modules)Themes and modules

Theme resources can be stored in light (YAML) or Maven [modules](../../../Modules/). Themes can reside in a dedicated theme module or form part of another module. A special module version handler is not necessary.

## [](#_resource_loading)Resource loading

All Magnolia [resources](../../Resources/), including theme resources, are loaded under the `/.resources` path.

-   In a Maven module, the resources are located in `/src/main/resources/<moduleName>` and any subfolder.

-   In a light module, resources can be located in any subfolder of your module (for example, `/<moduleName>/webresources/`).


Theme resources can also be loaded from an external source by specifying the full URL. This is very useful if you use a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) to store, cache and deliver your static resources.

See [Resources](../../Resources/) and [Module structure](../../../Modules/Module-structure/) for more.

## [](#_benefits_of_using_a_theme)Benefits of using a theme

Themes offer a number of benefits:

-   Theme resources are applied to the entire site.

-   Resources are all in one place.

-   Themes are an easy way to work with resources without having to modify the head section of your HTML.

-   You can define more than one theme and switch between them or apply a different theme to a variation of your site. For example, you could use a different theme for pages targeted at U.S. users and European users or a seasonal theme for different times of the year.

-   You can still use different or additional overriding resources on a page-template level.

## [](#_using_theme_resources_in_template_scripts)Using theme resources in template scripts

[FreeMarker development only](../Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia)

Theme resources are typically added to the `<head>` element of a page template.

-   Retrieve the configured theme configured over the [sitefn function](../Template-scripts/Templating-functions/sitefn/) class:

    \[#assign site =
    sitefn.site()!\]

    \[#assign theme =
    sitefn.theme(site)!\]

-   Iterate over the theme configuration and include the configured resources:

    \[#list theme.cssFiles as cssFile\]
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="${cssFile.link}" media="${cssFile.media}" />
    \[/#list\]

    \[#list theme.jsFiles as jsFile\]
        <script src="${jsFile.link}"></script>
    \[/#list\]


## [](#_viewing_and_editing_themes)Viewing and editing themes

Theme definitions from all sources and origins are available in the [Definitions app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Definitions-app/). Select **themes** in **Type** to find all theme definitions. You can hotfix themes in the [Resource Files](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Resource-Files-app/) app. Select the theme definition and click **Show in Resources app** in the Definitions app to access the file.

**Example**: `travel-demo-theme` in the Definitions app and Resource Files app.
