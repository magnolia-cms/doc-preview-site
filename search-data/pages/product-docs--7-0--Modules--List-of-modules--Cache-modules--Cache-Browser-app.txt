The Cache Browser app allows you to log in - remotely and simultaneously - to all public instances from the author instance to manage the cache. The app is a central point to control what’s in the cache. You can force-flush items by deleting, and download items for inspection and comparison.

No configuration is required. The public instances are detected automatically from the [receiver](../../../../Administration/Instances/Receivers/) configuration. The app is implementation-agnostic and works in the same way regardless on the installed cache engine.

The app is a subapp of the [Cache Tools app](../Cache-Tools-app/).

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.cache</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-cache-browser-app</artifactId>
  <version>7.0.0</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

## [](#_usage)Usage

The browser displays the content of the cache on all public instances. It gives you a single place of control and lets you explore the cache.

-   You can see whether content exists on only one or multiple public instances.

-   Compare content on different instances. For example, check whether the same image is served.

-   Check how your load balancer is working. For example, see if the cache is distributed evenly between instances.


To use the app:

-   On the author instance open the Browser subapp and log in. For your security, passwords are not stored. You need to login every time you use the app.

-   In the cache browser you can:

    -   Download items for inspection. Multiple items are delivered in a ZIP file.

    -   Delete items to force-flush them from the cache.
