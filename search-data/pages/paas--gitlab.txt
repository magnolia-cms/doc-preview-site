# GitLab CI/CD

DX Cloud works best when using [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in). This is because GitLab not only hosts the code, as all other `git` repositories and hosting services do, it also handles your DX Cloud deployment. If you do choose to use GitLab, your development changes are automatically picked up and deployed through what is configured in your [`.gitlab-ci.yml` file](../deployment/webapp_deployment/#_the_gitlab_ci_yml_file) using GitLab’s CI/CD setup.

> **Note:** It is not required that you use GitLab to host and deploy your DX Cloud project.

## [](#_what_are_the_benefits)What are the benefits?

We recommend GitLab for the build, integration, and deployment process. This way, developers can create temporary environments to work on features. They can then make these environments available to business stakeholders for testing and feedback.

Once a feature is completed, developers commit their code to the GitLab repository and GitLab handles the rest by automatically deploying the code to the integration environment, where it can be tested and deployed to UAT and production.
