# Search for content in Magnolia

Magnolia’s search tools make finding content simple, fast, and tailored to your needs. Whether you’re searching across all apps or within a specific one, intuitive features like the *Global Search* and *In-app search* help you locate exactly what you’re looking for.

Both options come with powerful filters to narrow down results, ensuring you can quickly pinpoint relevant content, even in large datasets.

Administrators can customize these filters to match your workflow, and integration with external data sources extends search capabilities beyond Magnolia’s core content.
