# Segments app

The Segments app allows you to divide visitors into segments based on a set of defined rules. Use segmentation together with personas in the [Preview app](../Preview-app/) to test content variants.

See [Personalization: Segmentation](../../../use-cases/Personalization/) for more information on how to use the app.

> **Note:** The Segments app is available only in DX Core.

### [](#_node_types)Node types
