# How to use a custom Page-editor app

Here we showcase a *fragment* use case provided by the [Page-editor apps extension](../../) feature. The sections below leverage the [`banner-lm`](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/documentation/demo-fragments-app/-/tree/main/magnolia/light-modules/banner-lm) light module definitions, which are described in more detail on [How to provision a custom Page-editor app](../how-to-provision-a-custom-page-editor-app/).

## [](#_the_banners_app)The Banners app

The `banner-lm` light module creates a pages app called *Banners*, which is intended to create and store page fragments. The fragments can be re-used on other pages as page components.

### [](#_an_image_as_a_page_fragment)An image as a page fragment

In this specific case, we intend to turn the following *Lone Cyclist* image into a reusable fragment:

### [](#_create_a_fragment)Create a fragment

-   In the Banners app, under the `banners` root node, create a new banner called `cycling1-2024`.

-   Edit the banner.

    -   Add a Text and image component to it.

    -   Edit the component.

        -   On its Image tab, in the Image field, browse to and select the *Lone Cyclist* image.




## [](#_the_pages_app)The Pages app

### [](#_use_the_fragment)Use the fragment

-   Go to the Magnolia Pages app.

-   Create a new page there. Call it *Cycling Fans Page 2024*, for example.

-   Add a Banner component from the available components.

-   Choose the `cycling1-2024` banner that you just created in the Banners app.

-   Your page now shows the contents of your banner.

### [](#_updating_the_banner_fragment)Updating the banner fragment

See how the page is auto-updated when the banner changes:

-   Go to the Banners app.

-   Edit the contents of the banner.

-   Go to the Pages app and edit the *Cycling Fans Page 2024* page.

-   Note that the content on the page reflects the changes in the banner.
