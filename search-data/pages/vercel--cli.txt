# Magnolia CLI

Before we initiate the integration process, ensure that the Magnolia Command Line Interface (CLI) is installed on your system. The CLI is a prerequisite that facilitates the creation, development, and maintenance of your Magnolia projects.

To successfully install the Magnolia CLI, your machine must have Node.js and Java already installed. These foundational platforms are crucial for running the CLI tool.

If the Magnolia CLI is not yet part of your development toolkit, please refer to the comprehensive installation instructions provided at the following link: [Magnolia CLI Installation Guide](../../magnolia-cli/). You don’t have to read the whole docs, you just need to follow the installation instructions.

Once you have the Magnolia CLI installed and set up on your machine, you can easily install Magnolia using the `mgnl jumpstart` command.

1.  Open your command line interface, and navigate to the directory where you want Magnolia to be installed.

2.  Run `mgnl jumpstart`.

    This command automatically downloads and sets up the latest version of Magnolia for you.

3.  To launch your newly installed Magnolia instance, run the command `mgnl start`.

    1.  Click on *Run the Web update* on the author instance and when prompted, enter "superuser" for both the username and password.

        Once Magnolia is installed and up and running, we will proceed to expose your local instance to the public internet, enabling your Vercel-deployed Next.js application to interact with Magnolia’s content APIs.
