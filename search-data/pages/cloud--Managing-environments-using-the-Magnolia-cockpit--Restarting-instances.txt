# Restarting instances

This page explains how to restart instances in your cloud-based Magnolia package. You may want to do this, for example, if an instance is not reachable due to high CPU or memory usage, or if you use a [YAML-based module descriptor](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/Module-descriptor/YAML-based-module-descriptor/) for light modules.

You can restart the Tomcat server (*default*) or restart the entire EC2 instance by selecting [Restart EC2 Instance](#ec2-restart).

Why restart EC2

In some cases, the EC2 instance can be inconsistent at the AWS hypervisor level. Restarting the entire EC2 instance resolves this problem.

> **Note:** When you restart an instance, the whole environment is unavailable for a short period of time (approx. 5 minutes).

> **Caution:** Be aware that restarting the author instance will close user sessions and may cause the loss of content that is in progress. We recommend you warn your end-users before restarting the author instance.

    > **Note:** Select Restart EC2 instance for a complete restart. If the EC2 restart times out, the request fails and the environment is unlocked.

5.  Confirm the consequences of the restart and click **Restart**.

    > **Note:** The operation takes approximately 5 minutes. During that time, the environment and all the instances it contains are unavailable.

6.  Click **OK**. As all actions in the Magnolia cockpit are asynchronous, you can click on **OK** before the action is complete.

    > **Note:** The action runs in the background and a notification will display once it is complete. The action also appears in the activity log.
