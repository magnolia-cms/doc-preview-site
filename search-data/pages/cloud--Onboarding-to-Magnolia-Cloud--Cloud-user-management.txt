# Cloud user management

When you subscribe to Magnolia Cloud, we provide you with login credentials to access both the cockpit and the cloud-based Magnolia instances in each environment.

All the users created by Magnolia belong to the default cloud groups:

-   `developers`

-   `owners`

-   `supporters`


> **Note:** These default cloud user groups have the superuser role by default. The default superuser user is disabled in Magnolia Cloud.

You must edit the roles assigned to the groups depending on the permissions you want to grant in the [Security app](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/) of the [author instance](../../Cockpit/#_edit_content_auth_instance) of each environment. The permissions you grant depend on your project requirements. In the Security app of the author instance of each environment, you can also create user accounts for users such as content editors who do not have access to the cockpit but work only with the instances.

You can view the default cloud user groups in the Security app and in the **People** section of the cockpit.
