# Tasks cleaner

> **Caution:** Magnolia 6.4 may not fully support all incubator modules yet. Get in touch with Magnolia support for more information.

The Tasks cleaner module is an [incubator module](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/#_module_list). It provides commands for managing tasks like scheduled publications that have been executed.

Tasks that have been successfully executed are marked as "resolved" and retained in the task workspace in your JCR repository. Resolved tasks can be marked as "archived" and will no longer be displaced in the Tasks app. "Archived" tasks can be marked as "removed".

Having many resolved tasks can affect:

-   the time to log in to Admincentral

-   the time to publish


| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `archiveTasks` | Check resolved tasks and mark selected tasks as archived according to configurable criteria. |
| `removeTasks` | Check archived tasks and mark selected task as removed according to configurable criteria. |
