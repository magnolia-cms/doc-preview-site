# Managing assets

Magnolia’s Digital Asset Management (DAM) system is the core component that manages all your digital files within Magnolia. It’s the powerful system working in the background that stores your files, manages their metadata, handles versioning, and creates different variations (renditions) of images.

The Assets App is your window into the DAM. When you use the Assets app to upload an image, video, or document, the DAM system organizes it, stores its associated information, and makes it available for use across your digital content.

## [](#_asset_storage)Asset storage

Magnolia offers different storage configurations based on your requirements:

-   Magnolia’s internal storage (JCR)

    Your files (binaries) and their metadata (like names and tags) are stored together in Magnolia’s internal system. This is the out-of-the-box setup and works well for most projects.

-   Hybrid storage with an external provider

    If you deal with a large number of files or very large files, like high-resolution videos, Magnolia can be configured to store the file metadata internally but keep the binaries in a third party tool, such as Amazon S3. Even with external binary storage, Magnolia continues to manage all asset metadata internally, which optimizes search and publishing performance.

-   Using an external DAM system

    If you already use a separate DAM system (like Bynder), Magnolia can connect to it. All your binaries and metadata stay in that external system, but you can still browse and use them within Magnolia. Magnolia provides out-of-the-box connectors for S3 and Bynder, and other third-party tools can be connected using our APIs.


Regardless of the underlying storage method, the Assets app within Magnolia remains your primary interface for managing all your digital assets. This means you consistently use the same tools to view, organize, and prepare your images, videos, and documents for use across your digital content.

## [](#_browsing_assets)Browsing assets

The Assets app shows your assets in a hierarchical tree, including the folder structure.

> **Tip:** Your Magnolia administrator can enable other views:List view - Displays the items individually in a flat list.This is the view you see when you search or filter assets.Thumbnail view - Displays thumbnail images of the assets. There is a zoom control at the top for resizing.

## [](#_how_to_handle_many_assets)How to handle many assets

The DAM supports a large number of assets. However, if you have more than **10 000** assets, organize them into folders.

If your asset count significantly exceeds 10 000, consider integrating an external storage system using our [External DAM integration framework](../../Modules/extensions-and-frameworks/external-dam-integration-framework/), our [DAM API](../../Developing/API/Java-Server-APIs/DAM-API/), or one of our [Incubator modules](../../../../incubator-modules/) extensions.

How many assets should I put in a folder?

For best performance with JCR assets, limit each folder to around 500 assets regardless of type (images, PDFs, etc.)

Use subfolders to stay organized and avoid performance issues.

-   Avoid placing too many assets in a single folder.

-   Use subfolders to improve performance and maintain structure.

-   `image/x-xwindowdump`

-   `image/x-cmx`

-   `image/cis-cod`

-   `image/ief`


### [](#_video_formats)Video formats

The following video formats *are* supported:

## [](#_character_restrictions)Character restrictions

Website content, asset, configuration and everything else is stored in the content repository. Each item is stored in a node. The node name is generally displayed in the first column in AdminCentral, for example the page name in the `website` workspace and asset name in the `dam` workspace. Besides being an internal reference to the node, the name is also used for various purposes such to create a page URL.

Character restrictions apply only to node names and not to other user-entered content. For example, you can only use certain characters in a page or asset name but any character in the page or asset title. When a disallowed character is used it is automatically substituted with a hyphen (`-`).

The info.magnolia.cms.core.Path class governs character restrictions. All alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`), hyphen (`-`) and underscore (`_`) are safe to use in node names. We recommend that you use lowercase letters separated by a hyphen.

### [](#_invalid_characters)Invalid characters

[JCR 2.0 specification](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/spec/jcr/2.0/3_Repository_Model.html#3.2.4%20Naming%20Restrictions) defines the following invalid characters in a local name.

|     | Common Name | Unicode Code and Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | Space | `0020` `SPACE` |
| `*` | Asterisk (Star) | `002A` `ASTERISK` |
| `/` | Forward slash | `002F` `SOLIDUS` |
| `:` | Colon | `003A` `COLON` |
| `[` | Left square bracket | `005B` `LEFT SQUARE BRACKET` |
| `]` | Right square bracket | `005D` `RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET` |
| `\|` | Vertical bar (Pipe) | `007C` `VERTICAL LINE` |

Node names are used to create URLs and cannot contain characters that are disallowed or have special meaning in URLs. These conventions are established by the Internet Engineering Task Force ([IETF](http://www.ietf.org/)) [Network Working Group on URLs](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt).

|     | Common Name | Unicode Code and Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `!` | Exclamation mark | `0021` `EXCLAMATION MARK` |
| `#` | Number sign (Hash) | `0023` `NUMBER SIGN` |
| `%` | Percent sign | `0025` `PERCENT SIGN` |
| `'` | Apostrophe | `0027` `APOSTROPHE` |
| `(` | Left parenthesis | `0028` `LEFT PARENTHESIS` |
| `)` | Right parenthesis | `0029` `RIGHT PARENTHESIS` |
| `+` | Plus sign | `002B` `PLUS SIGN` |
| `/` | Forward slash | `002F` `SOLIDUS` |
| `;` | Semicolon | `003B` `SEMICOLON` |
| `?` | Question mark | `003F` `QUESTION MARK` |
| `^` | Caret | `005E` `CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT` |

### [](#_characters_disallowed_by_magnolia)Characters disallowed by Magnolia

|     | Common Name | Unicode Code and Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `&` | Ampersand | `0026` `AMPERSAND` |
| `=` | Equals sign | `003D` `EQUALS SIGN` |
| `@` | At sign | `0040` `COMMERCIAL AT` |

Apart from the exceptions above, Magnolia allows you to use the full [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) character set for node names and other properties, but UTF-8 encoding is disabled by default.

See [UTF-8 in pages names](../../Administration/Language/Language-configuration/#_utf_8_page_names) for instructions on how to enable it. When enabled, all special characters and notations covered by the Unicode specification can also be used.

The dot character (full stop, Unicode 2E) can be used in node names with the single limitation that it cannot be the first character. You can create a user `john.smith`, a page `article.one`, a document `Magnolia-Flyer-4.0.pdf`, a configuration node `option.one` or a JavaScript file `jquery.tabtree`.
