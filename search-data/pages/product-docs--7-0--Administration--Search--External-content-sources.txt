# Search external content sources

You can use the Global Search to search not only through all your Magnolia content but also through content stored in external data sources. To do so, developers can build custom search result suppliers extending the Global Search’s capabilities using a [purpose-built API](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Periscope-module/#_creating_a_custom_search_result_supplier). The API facilitates integration with any outside source such as assets stored on Flickr or your client data in a CRM application.

## [](#_through_rest)Through REST

For configuration properties and an example showing how to configure a REST-based search result supplier, see [REST search result suppliers for Global Search](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/UI-Framework-REST-Extensions-module/REST-search-result-suppliers-for-Global-Search/).
