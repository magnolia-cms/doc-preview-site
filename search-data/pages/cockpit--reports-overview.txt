# Subscription reports help

Monitor your Magnolia DX Cloud subscription performance and resource usage. This dashboard shows real-time metrics across four key areas:

-   **Uptime**: Service availability for CDN, ingress, and Magnolia instances

-   **Traffic**: Data transfer volumes through your services

-   **Response times**: Performance metrics showing request speed

-   **Resources**: CPU, memory, and node usage across all your clusters


Use this data to track against your SLA commitments, identify performance trends, and plan capacity needs. Each metric shows current usage vs. your contracted limits, with historical charts to spot patterns over time.

You can find information on specific metrics in the **What is this?** section of each check card.
