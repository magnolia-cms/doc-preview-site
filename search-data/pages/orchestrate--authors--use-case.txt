# Orchestrate walk-through

Magnolia Orchestrate simplifies managing campaigns and content tasks, providing tools for marketing teams to plan, assign, track, and analyze campaigns. Here’s a detailed guide specifically for authors and marketing professionals to show the end-to-end usage of the module. All instructions on this page assume you are inside the Orchestrate app inside of Magnolia.

Scenario: You have a product launch for our new Snazzy Kitten sweaters. You want to ensure that the social media campaign, email campaign, Black Friday promotion, and all the associated work fit the desired timeline so your loyal customers can get their Snazzy Kitten sweater for the furry family members.

Check out our interactive demo using the scenario outlined here.



## [](#_walk_through_overview)Walk-through overview

Here is a high level overview. Click into each step for detailed instructions on how to achieve the task.

1.  First, [create a campaign folder](#_create_a_campaign_folder).

2.  Next, [create your campaign](#_create_a_campaign).

3.  Then, [create task folders](#_create_task_folders) inside your campaign.

4.  [Add tasks](#_add_tasks) to the folders or to teh campaign.

5.  [Manage your timeline](#_manage_your_timeline).

6.  [Track task progress](#_track_task_progress).


## [](#_create_a_campaign_folder)Create a campaign folder

First thing’s first, you need to create a campaign folder to hold everything about your campaign. Be sure to give the campaign folder a meaningful name so it’s easier to identify later. For example, Snazzy Kitten Sweaters.

1.  Go to your **Browser subapp**.

2.  Click **Add folder** in the Action bar.

    1.  If prompted, give the folder a name.

    2.  Otherwise, click **Rename item** in the Action bar and give the folder a name.


3.  Save your changes.

## [](#_create_a_campaign)Create a campaign

When you create a campaign, you should think of why you’re running the campaign and how long you want the campaign to last. These details help you identify the campaign later as well as plan how tasks are broken down for those involved in the campaign.

1.  Go to your **Browser subapp**.

2.  Click **Add campaign** in the Action bar.

    1.  Give the campaign a name.

    2.  Enter when you want the campaign to start in the **From** date field.

    3.  Enter when you want the campaign to end in the **To** date field.

    4.  Describe the campaign in **Brief**.


3.  Save your changes.

## [](#_create_task_folders)Create task folders

Now, you’ll want to organize tasks into folders for ease of planning.

1.  Go to your **Browser subapp**.

2.  Click **Add folder** in the Action bar.

    1.  If prompted, give the folder a name.

    2.  Otherwise, click **Rename item** in the Action bar and give the folder a name.


3.  Save your changes.

    ![3 name task folder](../_images/walk-through/3_name-task-folder.png)


## [](#_add_tasks)Add tasks

Now, you’ll want to add tasks into the task folders or if they’re general tasks, perhaps at the campaign level as shown here.

1.  Go to your **Browser subapp**.

2.  Click your desired campaign in your campaign folder. In the example, this is **Snazzy Kitten Sweaters**.

3.  Click **Add task** in the Action bar.

    1.  Give the task a meaningful **name**.

    2.  Enter a description of the task in **Content brief**.

    3.  Assign the task under **Assignee** by selecting someone from the dropdown list.

    4.  Give the task a **Due date**.

    5.  Assign the current **Status** to the task.

    6.  Give the task a **Priority**.

        Options

        -   High

        -   Medium

## [](#_manage_your_timeline)Manage your timeline

Once tasks are assigned, navigate to the Calendar Subapp. Here, you’ll see a visual representation of all scheduled tasks, making it easy to manage deadlines.

Drag-and-Drop Tasks

If deadlines shift, you can adjust task due dates by simply dragging tasks to new days in the calendar. This flexibility ensures real-time updates and efficient handling of delays or changes in priorities.

Adjust Task Responsibilities

In case of resource reallocation or unavailability of a team member, reassign tasks on the fly. This is done by opening the [task](#_add_tasks) and selecting a new assignee.

## [](#_track_task_progress)Track task progress

You can visualize your workflow with Kanban boards. This subapp is a visual Kanban board, allowing you to track the progress of tasks through different stages such as **Planned**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. Tasks can be moved between these states using drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier to identify what needs attention.

To continue with our Snazzy Kitten example:

1.  Go to your **Browser subapp**.

2.  Click the desired campaign, in this case, **Snazzy Kitten Sweaters**.

3.  Click **Open campaign board**.

4.  We see the **Design-campaign-ads** task is *In Progress* on the Kanban board.

5.  Move it to **Done** by dragging and dropping from the *In Progress* column to the *Done* column.
