# Creating a custom workflow process

To create a custom workflow process, it is highly recommended that you use the [Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler](http://www.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler) plugin available in the Eclipse marketplace.

> **Tip:** You can implement a simple 4-eye publishing workflow with Tasks. You do not need the Workflow module or jBPM unless your workflow is more complex, involving three participants or rejection.

## [](#_custom_workflows)Custom workflows

There are several incubator modules available that provide extended features for custom workflows.

-   [Six Eye Workflow module](../../../../../../six-eye-workflow/) adds a second configurable approval layer.

-   [Eight Eye Workflow module](../../../../../../eight-eye-workflow/) adds a third configurable approval layer.

-   [task-email-notifications:ROOT:index.adoc](#task-email-notifications:ROOT:index.adoc) sends emails without the need to customize the workflow.

-   [publication-task-config:ROOT:index.adoc](#publication-task-config:ROOT:index.adoc) routes approval step to different groups based on path and workspace.
