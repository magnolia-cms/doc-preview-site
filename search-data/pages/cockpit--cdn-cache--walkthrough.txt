# CDN Cache deep dive

## [](#_sidebar_filters)Sidebar filters

The sidebar filters lets you select your **Release environment**.

## [](#_browser_cache)Browser cache

Manage your browser cache policies. Browser caching controls the `Cache-Control` header sent to end users, determining how long their browsers store responses locally.

## [](#_cdn_cache)CDN cache

Manage your CDN cache policies. CDN caching controls the `Surrogate-Control` header. When the CDN sees this header, it uses it instead of `Cache-Control`, letting you give the browser and CDN different cache instructions.

For example, you might set `Cache-Control: no-cache` on images so browsers never cache them, while setting `Surrogate-Control: max-age=31536000` so the CDN caches them for a year. If you need to update the images later, you only invalidate the CDN cache and all browsers immediately get the new version.

CDN caching also helps serve cached content when Magnolia is down or experiencing issues.
