# jsonfn

[FreeMarker development only](../../../Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia)

`jsonfn` templating functions generate [JSON](http://json.org/) from JCR nodes in any workspace. This allows you to generate highly customized JSON without writing custom Java classes.

These [templating functions](../) are provided by the `magnolia-jsonfn` module which is hosted in the [github.com/magnolia-community/jsonfn](https://github.com/magnolia-community/jsonfn) repository. The `jsonfn` templating functions originated in the `neat-jsonfn` module, hosted on GitHub and developed by [rah003](https://github.com/rah003).

## [](#_installation)Installation

`jsonfn` templating functions are not bundled with preconfigured Magnolia bundles or webapps.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.templating</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-jsonfn</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.9</version> (1)
</dependency>
```
