# Component autogeneration

Autogeneration creates components inside an area automatically without editor involvement. Anything you define under the `content` node will be autogenerated.

## [](#_autogeneration_behavior)Autogeneration behavior

Autogenerated components behave differently from normal components:

-   **Ordered as defined**: In an empty area, components are autogenerated in the same order as they are defined in the area definition.

-   **New components are placed last**: If an area already has autogenerated components, newly defined components will be placed last.

-   **Cannot delete permanently**: When you delete an autogenerated component, it is regenerated and placed last in the area.


## [](#_autogeneration_properties)Autogeneration properties

Configure component autogeneration in an [area definition](../) under the `autoGeneration` node.

Example definition

```yml
areas:
  footer:
    renderType: freemarker
    type: single
    autoGeneration:
      content:
        quotation:
          nodeType: mgnl:component
          templateId: my-module:components/quotation
          quotationText: <p>Carpe diem.</p>

Properties under `autoGeneration`

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `content` | **required**<br><br>Parent node for autogenerated content. Anything you define under this node will be autogenerated. To create multi-value properties, see the `references` property in the [example definition](#_autogeneration_properties) above. |
| `<component name>` | **required**<br><br>Name of the autogenerated component. |
| `nodeType` | **required**<br><br>When set to `mgnl:component`, defines the referenced item as a component and generates a component node. |
| `templateId` | **required**<br><br>Component ID in `<module>:<path>` format that references a [component definition](../../Component-definition/). |
| `generatorClass` | **required**, *default is `info.magnolia.rendering.generator.CopyGenerator`*<br><br>Class that generates nodes based on the definition. The default info.magnolia.rendering.generator.CopyGenerator creates a copy of the exact nodes and properties you define under the `content` node. To create a custom generator class, make sure you implement the info.magnolia.rendering.generator.Generator interface. |
