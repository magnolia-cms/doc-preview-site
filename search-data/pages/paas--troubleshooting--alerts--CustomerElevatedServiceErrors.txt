# Elevated service errors

## [](#_symptom)Symptom

A `CustomerElevatedServiceErrors` alert is firing.

It indicates a service is showing a high level of errors (5xx responses) from a service, specifically:

-   if a service is running on a production cluster AND

-   the service is receiving more than 6 requests / minute AND

-   more than `10%` of the responses from the service are 5xx for the last `10` minutes


> **Important:** These alerts apply to any service used by an ingress - Magnolia service, frontend service, redirect service or other service - running on a production cluster.

> **Note:** CustomerElevatedServiceErrors alerts are sent to subscribers via email.

## [](#_solutions)Solutions

This section provides solutions that should help resolve the issue in most cases.

### [](#_investigate_cause_for_elevated_service_errors)Investigate cause for elevated service errors

Unfortunately there is no easy resolution for elevated service errors alerts; there are many possible causes for service errors.

Possible causes for the elevated service errors:

-   The ingress is misconfigured: service selector does not find the expected service (check the ingress configuration)

-   No pods for the service are running: pods are restarting or crashlooping (check the pod status with kubectl or Rancher)

-   No pods for the service are running: deployment / daemonset / statefulset is scaled down to 0 pods (check the deployment / daemonset / statefulset with kubectl or Rancher)

-   Pods are running but are returning errors (do this as a last resort! Logs are often verbose and are difficult to interpret)
