# The pipeline

When DX Cloud is set up with GitLab, changes in your project automatically trigger your pipeline via what is configured in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

This way, changes are picked up automatically and you don’t have to worry about it. However, the final *deployment* step is sometimes manual and you’ll need to make a deploy action to finish the process. This is typically done by clicking a button manually in GitLab.
