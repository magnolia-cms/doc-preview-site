# Magnolia 6.3.4 known issues

## [](#_imported_content_cant_be_published_without_metadata_updates)Imported content can’t be published without metadata updates

This issue affects publishing when the imported files contain publishing properties, both for bootstrapped files or those imported via the UI when metadata and published versions are out of sync. In particular, when some nodes have the property `mgnl:lastActivatedVersion` and the corresponding version doesn’t exist, you can’t publish them without modifying them first. In addition, if a published node is modified in a way that doesn’t update Magnolia modification metadata, publishing also won’t succeed.

For more details, see [MAGNOLIA-9554](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9554).

### [](#_workaround)Workaround

There are two workarounds to this issue:

1.  Before importing, erase publishing properties from import files, for example, using the following command.

    ```bash
    sed -i '' '/^[[:space:]]*mgnl:lastActivatedVersion:/d' <YOUR_FILE_TO_IMPORT>.yaml
    ```

    > **Note:** We also recommend deleting any mgnl:activationStatus properties to avoid inconsistencies related to the publication state.

2.  After importing, in the UI, unpublish imported nodes before publishing them.


## [](#_passwords_lost_when_editing_users_in_the_security_app)Passwords lost when editing users in the Security app

If you edit a user in the [Security app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Security-app/), the user’s password is removed. As a consequence, they can’t log in anymore.

For more details, see [MAGNOLIA-9559](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-9559).

We’re actively working on resolving the issue.
