# Installing Magnolia

This page instructs you on installing Magnolia on your machine. This could be your own laptop for local development-purposes, a beta-testing environment, or even as part of a pipeline for production. As an alternative to the instructions here, you can use the [Magnolia CLI](../../../../magnolia-cli/) to install and start Magnolia.

Production installs

If you are installing Magnolia for production purposes, there is typically additional installation, configuration steps, and testing phases that are not mentioned in this guide. You should consult with your operations and security team to prepare for a full production environment.

For more details, see [Modifying the magnolia.home property](../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Configuration-management/#_modifying_the_magnolia_home_property) as a starting point.

|  | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| **Check for JAVA_HOME** | • Open the command prompt. • Type `set` and press `ENTER` . • Find `JAVA_HOME` in the command output and verify that the path points to your JDK installation directory, for example, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>>.xx` . • If `JAVA_HOME` is missing or it points to the wrong directory, see **Set JAVA_HOME** . |
| **Set JAVA_HOME** | • Open the Command Prompt as an administrator. • Set the path for `JAVA_HOME` . `setx /m JAVA_HOME "path\to\Java\jdk" (1)` ** **1** Where `path\to\Java\jdk` is where your Java Development Kit is saved. The `set` command creates the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and sets its value to the JDK directory. The command is executed when Magnolia starts. | ** **1** | Where `path\to\Java\jdk` is where your Java Development Kit is saved. |

## [](#_download_magnolia)Download Magnolia

1.  Download Magnolia.

    [Magnolia Community Edition](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/repository/magnolia.public.releases/info/magnolia/demo/travel-demo-community-webapp/6.3.21/travel-demo-community-webapp-6.3.21-tomcat-bundle.zip)

2.  Extract the zip file to your preferred directory on your machine.

    Zip structure and storage

    magnolia-x.y/
    ├── add-ons/
    └── apache-tomcat-x.y/
        ├── bin/
        ├── conf/
        ├── lib/
        ├── logs/
        ├── temp/
        ├── webapps/
        | ├── magnoliaAuthor/
        | ├── magnoliaPublic/
        | └── ROOT/
        └── work/

    Example storage location

    `C:\Users\<username>\magnolia`.

    If you are installing Magnolia for personal use, extract the zip to `/home/<your account>` or equivalent directory.

    If you are installing onto a production server, extract the zip to `/usr/local` or `/opt`. A standard user account may not have permissions to extract files into a target directory such as `/opt`. If this is the case:

    1.  Extract the zip in the folder where you downloaded it.

    2.  Open a terminal and move the extracted folder using your ROOT admin command such as `sudo mv magnolia-x.y`.

        The `sudo` command executes the `mv` (move) command as `superuser`, prompting you for a password.



## [](#_start_magnolia)Start Magnolia

Go to the `magnolia-x.y/apache-tomcat-x.y/bin` directory and run:

```sh
./magnolia_control.sh start --ignore-open-files-limit (1)
```
