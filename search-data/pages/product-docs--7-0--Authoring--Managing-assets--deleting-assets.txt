# Deleting assets

[Versioning](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Versioning/) is enabled in the DAM. This allows you to restore previous versions of an asset or folder.

To delete an asset or folder:

1.  Select an item.

2.  Click **Mark for deletion**

3.  Confirm your action in the dialog.

    This marks the asset/folder for deletion and creates a restorable version. The row is grayed out and the item is no longer available in chooser dialogs.

    > **Tip:** In the confirmation dialog, the Links column displays the number of affected links for individual or multiple items. When deleting a folder, the column shows the total number of affected links for all items within the folder.

4.  Click **Delete permanently** to complete the deletion. After deleting permanently, you can no longer restore the item.


For more information about deleting and restoring, see [Deleting and restoring](../../Deleting-and-restoring/).
