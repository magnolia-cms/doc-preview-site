# DAM sizing considerations

## [](#_estimating_dam_size)Estimating DAM size

Targeting a smaller DAM based on initial size estimations can be a costly migration process if it needs to be expanded later.

However, no one-size-fits-all approach works for estimation. Various factors should be considered, including:

-   **Data models** influence the choice of database. Relational databases are often more complex and involve more join operations. Non-relational databases use documents, key-value pairs, and other formats but tend to have more duplication and storage requirements due to denormalization.

-   **Amount of data**

-   **Growth rate** of the data volume for business needs and changing user behaviors

-   **Query patterns**

    -   Pinpoint the critical and common queries that need support

    -   Indexing can enhance the speed, accuracy, and relevance of your queries
