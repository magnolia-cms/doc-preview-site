# Attaching a SPA project to Magnolia

This page describes how you can attach a Single-Page Application (SPA) project to Magnolia so that its content could be edited in the author instance of Magnolia.

The SPA project used as an example on this page is called `angular-sample` and is assembled from two page templates provided by a light module `angular-lm`, which is part of the project.

We only showcase a project built in the Angular framework. However, a similar result could also be achieved with the ReactJS and Vue frameworks, the other two front-end frameworks currently supported by Magnolia [SPA front-end helper libraries](../magnolia-front-end-sdk/).

## [](#_prerequisites)Prerequisites

### [](#_node_js_npm_and_magnolia)Node.js, npm and Magnolia

For development and testing, you need to install:

-   Node.js

-   npm

-   Java (JRE or JDK)

-   Magnolia


If you haven’t installed them yet, go to the page [Installing Magnolia through npm CLI (dx-core documentation)](../../../../Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Installing-Magnolia/Installing-Magnolia-through-npm-CLI/) and complete the steps described there.

> **Warning:** For now, skip the step asking you to start Magnolia by entering the mgnl start command.

### [](#_angular_npm_cli)Angular npm CLI

Make sure that the `@angular/cli` npm package is installed as well. If it is not, you can install it by executing the following command:

`sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`

### [](#_creating_an_angular_workspace)Creating an Angular workspace

Create a folder called `dev`, preferably at the same level as the `magnolia` directory. Change to the new folder and create the `angular-sample` workspace in it by copying the `/frontend-helpers-v1/samples/angular-sample/` folder from our `frontend-helpers-v1` repository:

`git clone https://gitlab.com/magnolia-ce/frontend-sdk/frontend-helpers-v1.git`

### [](#_linking_the_light_modules_folder_to_magnolia)Linking the light-modules folder to Magnolia

The workspace contains the `light-modules` folder, which you need to link up with the Magnolia installation.

1.  Go to the `magnolia` folder, where you installed Magnolia.

2.  Delete the existing `light-modules` folder.

3.  Create a symbolic link to the `/dev/angular-sample/light-modules` folder. On a Linux machine, the command to do this would be:

    `ln -s /home/<user-name>/dev/angular-sample/light-modules /home/<user-name>/magnolia/light-modules`


## [](#_configuration)Configuration

### [](#_setting_server_url_for_the_application_environment)Setting server URL for the application environment

In the `dev` folder, navigate to `angular-sample/src/environments` and in the `environments.ts` file, check that the `HOST` and `CONTEXT_PATH` variables are set to `http://localhost:8080` and `/magnoliaAuthor`, respectively.

### [](#_granting_the_anonymous_user_rest_access)Granting the anonymous user REST access

In Magnolia, you must allow anonymous access to `/.rest/*`.

1.  Start Magnolia by executing `mgnl start`.

2.  Login to the Magnolia author instance.

3.  In the App launcher, open the Security app.

4.  Under the **Roles** tab, highlight the `anonymous` user and click **Edit role** in the Action bar.

5.  Under **Web access**, add a new `/.rest/` **access path and click \*Save changes**:
    ![ACl/web access dialog for anonymous role](../../../../_images/headless/6-2-AttachingAnSPApagetoMagnolia_restWebAccess.png)


## [](#_installing_and_building_the_project)Installing and building the project

In this step, you install all of the dependencies that are listed in the project’s `package.json`, then build the project and serve it through a local Angular server.

1.  In the `/dev/angular-sample/` folder, enter the following commands:

    `npm install`
    `npm run build`


2.  In the same location, start the local Angular server by executing the `ng serve` command.


## [](#_sample_page_content)Sample page content

To access an example SPA page utilizing the project’s templates:

1.  Open the Pages app.

2.  Use the **Import** action of the Action bar to import page content from the `website.angular-sample.yaml` file. You can find it in the `sample-content` subfolder of the `angular-sample` workspace.

3.  You should now see two new pages in the Pages app:

    -   `angular-sample`

    -   `two-columns`



To view the result SPA page **in Magnolia**, highlight the `angular-sample` page and click the **Preview** action.

To view the page **as served by the `ng` server**, open a new browser window and enter `localhost:4200`.
