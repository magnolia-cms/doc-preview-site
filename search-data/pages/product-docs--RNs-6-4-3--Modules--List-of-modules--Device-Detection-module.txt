## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.devdect</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-module-device-detection</artifactId>
  <version>{magnolia-module-device-detection}</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

The default configuration detects mobile devices, splitting them into two groups: smartphones and tablets. You don’t need to change anything unless you want to detect other types of devices or other capabilities.

## [](#_device_detection_filter)Device detection filter

info.magnolia.module.devicedetection.filter.DeviceDetectionFilter is registered in the [Magnolia filter chain](../../../Administration/Architecture/Request-processing-and-filters/Filters/) at **Configuration >** `/server/filters/deviceDetection`. The purpose of this filter is to intercept the incoming request and discover the capabilities of the device based on its `User-Agent` header.

All devices identify themselves in the `User-Agent` request header. Here is an example what the header looks like when an iPhone 3GS requests the Magnolia corporate home page. The header basically says \`\`I am an iPhone running iOS 4.0.2 and the Safari browser''.

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| info.magnolia.module.devicedetection.DeviceDetectionModule | Implements `ModuleLifecycle` and ensures the costly `initCapability` method in `DeviceCapability` is called only once. |
| info.magnolia.module.devicedetection.mobiledetect.MobileDetectDeviceCapability | Implements the info.magnolia.module.devicedetection.DeviceCapability interface and provides information about the capabilities of the device. Gets `DeviceInfo` . |
| info.magnolia.module.devicedetection.DeviceInfo | Provides information about the device. All attributes are initially set to defined defaults. |

## [](#_device_channel_configuration)Device channel configuration

In order to serve content to the device in an appropriate format, a channel is resolved next. info.magnolia.module.devicedetection.DeviceChannelResolver is registered in the Configuration app (`/server/rendering/channelManagement/channels`). This resolver resolves the channel to use based on the `DeviceInfo` object.

The channel is mapped to a variation. The variation consists of templates and a theme that optimizes the content for displaying on the device.
