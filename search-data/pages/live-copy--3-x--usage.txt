# Using Live Copy

Live Copy enables you to create one or more copies of a master website. The master can be an entire site, a sub-tree or just a single page.

Because the copies created remain linked to the master version, any changes you make to the master version can be *pushed* to the copies too.

If you want some of your content in the copied sites to be different, you can add new, local content or protect the initial content copied over from further changes and edit it to suit your requirements.

> **Warning:** As a lot of content can be copied and linked, a single wrong action can have a negative impact on a big part of your website unintentionally including content that can be detrimental for your business.To avoid this, make sure you plan your content structure in detail before using Live Copy.
