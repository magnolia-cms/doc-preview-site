# JCR Browser app

The JCR Browser app is a Magnolia tool that allows you to work at the repository level in any [workspace](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Workspaces/). You can see details not readily visible in a specific app’s tree view and edit content and associated configuration.

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

The JCR Browser app is in the JCR Tools app group and is only available to the `superuser` role. This restriction is configured in the [App launcher layout](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/App-Launcher/App-launcher-layout/).

The app is configured in `/jcr-browser/apps/jcr-browser-app.yaml`.

## [](#_using_the_app)Using the app

> **Caution:** Be careful when editing and adding content in any workspace because you work at the repository level.

-   **Searching and filtering**:

    -   Switch between workspaces using the **Workspace** filter. All workspaces are available. If you create a new workspace, it’s automatically available in the app.

        ![Switching between workspaces ](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/_images/apps/jcr-browser/jcr-browser-app-workspace-filter.png)


-   Filter by **Status**:

    -   Draft

    -   Marked for deletion

    -   Modified

    -   Published


-   **Display system properties**: Select the checkbox to display properties such as UUIDs, creation dates, and user information. System properties are hidden by default. When displayed, you can’t edit them.

-   **Editing**: You can work with all content, except system properties, in the same way as in any other app.


> **Warning:** Editing content directly in the JCR browser rather than in a dedicated app may damage the integrity of your data. Don’t move nodes (such as components from one page area to another), as the dedicated app might apply additional constraints to the move operation. Publishing in the JCR browser might differ from publishing in a dedicated app because different rules might apply for including subnodes.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `jcr:created` | The date when the node was created. This is automatically created. Each node’s creation date is registered through this property of the [JCR primary node type](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Node-types/#_prefixes) `nt:version` . |
| `jcr:createdBy` | Who (or what) created the node. |
| `jcr:primaryType` | The base primary node type. This is automatically created. |
| `jcr:uuid` | A mandatory, protected `STRING` that exposes the node identifier. |
