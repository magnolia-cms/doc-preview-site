# Submitting incubator tickets

At Magnolia, our Incubator team works on modules in structured development batches. To help us work more efficiently and increase the chances of your ticket being picked up sooner, we encourage you to follow the guidelines below when submitting an Incubator ticket.

## [](#_what_to_include_in_your_ticket)What to include in your ticket

### [](#_description)Description

Start with a clear and detailed description of your issue, request, or improvement idea. The more context you can provide, the better.

### [](#_use_case)Use Case

What are you trying to achieve? Describe the scenario where this ticket comes into play. A strong use case helps us understand the practical value and priority of your request.

### [](#_proposal_optional)Proposal (optional)

If you’ve already thought of a possible solution or even implemented a hotfix, feel free to share it.

You can:

-   Describe the approach or logic

-   Share code snippets or configuration ideas

-   Link to a public repo or reference implementation


### [](#_impact)Impact

Tell us how this affects you. Consider both the positive impact if fixed and the negative impact if left unresolved.

For example:

-   Improved developer experience

-   Reduced complexity

-   Increased security

-   Broken UI, performance issues, or blocked users


### [](#_steps_to_reproduce_or_validate)Steps to reproduce or validate

Give us a detailed, step-by-step guide:

-   How can we reproduce the issue or verify your suggestion?

-   Include YAML configs, paths, and precise steps.

-   Screenshots, logs, or screen recordings are highly appreciated.

-   Write this section as if we’re not part of your project. This ensures clarity for everyone involved.


### [](#_expected_versus_current_behavior)Expected versus current behavior

-   What behavior did you expect?

-   What is the current behavior instead?

-   Are there any visible errors, log messages, or silent failures?


Understanding the gap between expected and actual behavior helps us resolve issues faster and more accurately.
