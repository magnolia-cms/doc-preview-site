# DX Cloud Identity and Access Management

In the Cockpit, roles define the access permissions a user has for various sections and actions. Each role is associated with specific capabilities, and users must have the required roles to interact with or view different parts of the system.

This page outlines the customer groups along with the roles and how they control access across features in the cockpit.

In addition to Cockpit roles, descriptions for customer Rancher access are also described here.

> **Note:** You must also have the feature toggled on for you. PaaS support can enable a feature for you.

## [](#_groups)Groups

For the Cockpit, there are groups to which you add users. These groups contain permissions through their assigned roles.

-   **customer-admins**: contains all [roles](#_roles).

-   **customer-devops**

    See roles
