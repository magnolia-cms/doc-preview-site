# Repository Tools app

The Repository Tools app allows you to manipulate repository content. You can run garbage collection on any workspace and purge versions of deleted content. The Jackrabbit datastore expects you to run GC manually so we have provided a way to do that via the app. The purge versions is used to delete versions which are kept even on content deletion. This provides a way to remove those via the app.
