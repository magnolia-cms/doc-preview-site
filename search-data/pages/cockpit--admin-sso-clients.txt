# SSO clients

Our [magnolia-sso:ROOT:index.adoc](#magnolia-sso:ROOT:index.adoc) enables secure, authentication by integrating with your Identity Provider (IDP). This lets your users access a Magnolia instance using their existing credentials, streamlining workflows and enhancing security.

For DX Cloud deployments, configuring an SSO client is essential to connect your IDP to Magnolia.

If your IDP uses SAML instead of OIDC, we need to bridge the gap by routing authentication through Keycloak. Proper client configuration ensures smooth and secure access across your environments.

You must only create one SSO client per environment (e.g., production, integration).
