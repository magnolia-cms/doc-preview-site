# Image Recognition

[Digital asset management (DAM)](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) Unbundled: [Extension](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/#_module_types) Version 4.0.0 [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

Magnolia image recognition extends the search capabilities of the [Global Search](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Authoring/Search/Global-search/) by automatically recognizing and tagging the content of image assets, allowing you to get more relevant results when searching.

## [](#_whats_in_an_image)What’s in an image?

How can Magnolia’s image recognition feature help your content editors? Consider the following example image that depicts the [Mount Bromo volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Bromo), a popular tourist attraction in East Java, Indonesia.

![Mount Bromo volcano](_images/flickr_indonesia_michael_day_2564067897_8d17df6972_b.jpg)

The image is used as a signature image for the **Island hopping in Indonesia** example tour in Magnolia’s [Travel Demo](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Getting-started-with-Magnolia/Demo/Travel-demo-for-editors/) and is stored as an asset in the `dam` workspace.

Imagine the editor is at the beginning of the writing process. Only the tour’s title **Island hopping in Indonesia** has been chosen and now an image with a volcano would be useful to accompany the tour’s description.

-   Would searching for the term *volcano* in the assets produce a result like this image?

-   What would assist the editor in deciding whether an image is suitable for the story?


## [](#_image_recognition_and_tagging)Image recognition and tagging

Magnolia’s image recognition feature automatically tags image assets in the `dam` workspace, helping you obtain a more informed view of the content of each asset stored in the workspace:

The tags are then available for use in any other Magnolia content app or your custom content apps (the Assets app is shown below):

## [](#_integration_with_global_search)Integration with Global Search

Magnolia’s image recognition and tagging make it easy to search for specific images among your assets:

## [](#_recognition_services)Recognition services

Magnolia integrates with Amazon Rekognition to offer advanced image recognition and generate a refined set of image tags.

In Image Recognition 2.0.1 and later, Magnolia also supports direct image analysis from Amazon S3. This means that if your assets are stored in an S3 bucket, the processing can be done directly in S3 without needing to load the image into memory. This significantly reduces memory consumption, improves performance, and prevents system restarts when handling large images.

> **Note:** Amazon Rekognition has a 15MB size limit for images processed directly from S3.

For more information on analyzing images stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, see the [AWS Rekognition Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/images-s3.html).

The Image Recognition module can also be configured for use with any other image recognition solution through the `ImageRecogniser` interface.
