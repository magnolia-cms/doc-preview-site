# Basic upload field - 5 UI

Deprecated

> **Note:** This basic upload field definition has been deprecated since Magnolia 6.0. It is part of the Magnolia 5 UI framework.For the updated implementation, see Upload field for Magnolia 6 UI instead.

`BasicUploadFieldDefinition` renders a field to upload a file to a Magnolia JCR workspace. The file is stored on the node of the current context of the form (within a dialog or subApp), which could be a content app item, a page or a component of a page.

class: `info.magnolia.ui.form.field.definition.BasicUploadFieldDefinition`

fieldType: `basicUpload`

The basic upload field has three states. You can set properties for each.

-   **Empty** is the starting point where no file has been selected. You can select a file with the button or drag it into the box.

-   **In progress** displays a progress bar and incremental percentages and uploaded/total ratio.

When using the basic upload field in a [composite](../Composite-field-5-UI/) or [multivalue](../Multivalue-field-5-UI/) field, use the [DelegatingCompositeFieldTransformer](../../Transforming-field-values-5-UI/#_delegatingcompositefieldtransformer). The other transformer classes do not work.
