# CDN request logs

CDN request logs provide detailed records of all HTTP requests processed through your Content Delivery Network (CDN). These logs help you monitor traffic patterns, troubleshoot issues, and analyze the performance of your content delivery.

Each log entry captures essential information about individual requests, including timestamps, HTTP methods, request paths, status codes, response times, and client details.
