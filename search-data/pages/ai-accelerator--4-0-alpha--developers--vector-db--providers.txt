# Providers and models

| Provider Type | Purpose | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Embedding Provider** | Generates vector embeddings from text | OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Gemini |
| **Vector Database** | Stores and searches embeddings | PostgreSQL pgvector |

| Model | Dimensions | Cost/1M tokens | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536 | $0.02 | General purpose, cost-effective `modelId: text-embedding-3-small` |
| `text-embedding-3-large` | 3072 | $0.13 | Higher quality, better accuracy `modelId: text-embedding-3-large` |
| `text-embedding-ada-002` | 1536 | $0.10 | Legacy model (use 3-small instead) |

| Metric | Operator | Use Case | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cosine` | `<⇒` | **Normalized embeddings** (default) | Best for OpenAI, Cohere, and most cloud embedding providers. Measures the cosine of the angle between vectors. |
| `l2` | `<→` | Non-normalized embeddings | Euclidean distance. Use for embedding models that don’t normalize output vectors. |
| `inner_product` | `<#>` | Alternative for normalized | Dot product similarity. Can be used with normalized embeddings as an alternative to cosine. |
