# Passwords app

The Passwords app, installed by the [Password Manager](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Password-Manager-module/) module, allows you to manage (add, import, change, delete) passwords centrally in the administration of Magnolia. By default, only the `superuser` role has access to the Passwords app.

## [](#_creating_passwords)Creating passwords

To create a password:

1.  Click **Add folder** to create a folder to contain and organize your passwords.

    When creating a folder name, all the spaces in the name of the folder are replaced with a dash (-) character when you save.

2.  Click **Add password** in the action bar to create a password in a folder.

    When typing characters in the password value fields, the value is always displayed as asterisks. The **Password ID** field shows the password’s JCR UUID, which can be used to reference the password in the registry.

3.  Click **Publish**.

    You have to publish passwords for them to be accessible on the public instance.


Later, you can use the **Edit password** action to change the name or the value of the password.

## [](#_duplicating_passwords)Duplicating passwords

If you duplicate an existing password using the **Duplicate password** action in the Action bar of the app, the duplicated (new) password’s value remains the same as the original but it’s assigned a new UUID.

## [](#_importing_and_exporting_passwords)Importing and exporting passwords

Content can be exported and imported for bootstrapping like any other workspace. However, the same encryption key must be used to decrypt the imported passwords as well as encrypt the export.

> **Note:** For security reasons, we don’t recommend bootstrapping password values.

## [](#_use_cases)Use cases

### [](#_amazon_rekognition_access_keys)Amazon Rekognition access keys

Magnolia’s [Image Recognition](../../../../../image-recognition/) feature allows you to use the Amazon Rekognition service for image recognition. The configuration for this feature requires storing two access keys in the Passwords app, see [Image recognition configuration](../../../../../image-recognition/developers/configure/).

### [](#_mail_app)Mail app

Let’s suppose you want to use a password stored in the Passwords app in the configuration of how Magnolia sends emails.

1.  Open the Mail tools app

2.  Select **Authentication with username and password**.

3.  In the **Password** field, click **Select new…** to choose an existing password from the Passwords app.


In this way, you can reuse the same password in more apps and have fewer passwords to remember.

## [](#_referencing_passwords)Referencing passwords

Don’t use the module and relative path to reference a password in the registry. There are several drawbacks to this method. Rather, use the password’s JCR UUID.

Example: Defining a link field for choosing passwords

```js
fields:
  - name: passwordKeyStoreId
    fieldType: link
    targetWorkspace: keystore
    appName: password-manager
    label: Select password
    identifierToPathConverter:
      class: info.magnolia.ui.form.field.converter.BaseIdentifierToPathConverter
```
