# Feature environments

If your DX Cloud project requires that you have different environments than the default 3 environments (*dev, uat, prod*), you can configure your [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](#gitlab-ci-file) file to have whatever environments you like.

A typical use-case for this would be temporary feature environments where you work on a new feature or improvement that you want to see fully before it goes into `uat` and onto `prod`. You can do this by ensuring your [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](#gitlab-ci-file) file is configured to reflect the name of those environments.

> **Note:** Once configured in the .gitlab-ci.yml file, you can easily view and manage your environments directly from the Cockpit.

## [](#_instructions)Instructions

To create a feature environment:

1.  Create a new cluster (*if needed*). Otherwise, use an existing cluster.

2.  On your desired cluster, create a kubernetes namespace with your temporary environment name.

3.  Add the environment to your [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](#gitlab-ci-file-fe) file to ensure it’s part of your pipeline.

4.  Make sure you add the environment to your [values.yml](../webapp_deployment/#_the_values_yml_file) file.


## [](#gitlab-ci-file-fe)`.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
...

deploy-FEATURE:
  extends: .deploy
  script:
    - export DEPLOYMENT=FEATURE (1)
    - export LE_ENVIRONMENT=letsencrypt-prod
    - cat values.yml | gomplate > ${DEPLOYMENT}.yml
    - cat ${DEPLOYMENT}.yml
    - helm upgrade -i ${DEPLOYMENT} mironet/magnolia-helm --version ${HELM_CHART_VERSION} -f ${DEPLOYMENT}.yml --create-namespace -n ${DEPLOYMENT}
  environment:
    name: dev
  when: manual

...
```
