# Feed components configuration

The feed components are configured in `/modules/rssaggregator/templates/components`.

![Feed components configuration](../../../_images/ADVT-feeds.png)

-   `combinedFeedsParagraph`: Combines all feeds in a channel and displays them sequentially. Editors can set the number, sort order and character limit of the entries. Use with standard or planet feeds.
    ![Combined feeds paragraph](../../../_images/6-1-Feeds-exampleCombined.png)

-   `feedListParagraph`: Displays a defined number of entries for each feed in the channel. The external feed title is used if no internal title is set. Editors can set the number, sort order and character limit of the entries. Use with standard or planet feeds.

-   `planetFeeds`: Displays the entries of all feeds in a channel with the latest appearing first. Uses the HTML of the source entry. This means that images and links are preserved and displayed. Allows pagination. Use with planet feeds only.

-   `feedSyndication`: Uses [planet statistics data](#_planet_statistics_storage) to display a list of authors with feed subscription icons and links to the external website. Author list is ordered by post frequency with top contributors appearing first. Editors can set a title and subtitle, define the number of authors to include, and whether links and the post count should be included. Use with planet feeds only.

-   `feedStatistics`: Displays Atom and RSS subscription icons and links that allow users to subscribe to the feed on your site. Editors can add a title and select a planet feed. Use with planet feeds only.


## [](#_creating_a_custom_component)Creating a custom component

The model class and template script are the important properties that determine content in the different components. All RSS model classes extend info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.templates.components.AbstractFeedModel, which provides the business logic to retrieve a defined feed and its data from the `rss` workspace and supports:

-   Entry sorting by title or publication data.

-   Ascending and descending entry sorting.

-   Maximum results property. *Default is \`20\`*.

-   Search capabilities


Any custom model class should extend `AbstractFeedModel`.

## [](#_adding_components_to_templates)Adding components to templates

You can add the [feed components](#_feed_components) to any template.

**Example**: Template definition with all feed components in `main` area.

/my-module/templates/pages/myTemplate.yaml

```js
templateScript: /my-module/templates/pages/my-script.ftl
renderType: freemarker
visible: true
title: My template
areas:
  main:
    availableComponents:
      combinedFeeds:
        id: rssaggregator:components/combinedFeedsParagraph
      feedList:
        id: rssaggregator:components/feedListParagraph
      planetFeeds:
        id: rssaggregator:components/planetFeeds
      feedStatistics:
        id: rssaggregator:components/feedStatistics
      feedSyndication:
        id: rssaggregator:components/feedSyndication
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `config` | **required** Module configuration node. |
| `automatedImport` | **required** , *default is false* Enables and disables automated imports. |
| `cron` | **required** The cron pattern for scheduled imports. |
| `fetcherClass` | **required** info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.importhandler.FastRSSFeedFetcher retrieves RSS feed content over HTTP. Fetches all feed channels defined in an aggregate feed. You can use info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.importhandler.SimpleRSSFeedFetcher as an alternative. This is a simple, single-threaded fetcher that reduces server load and is suitable when you don’t have many feed channels and you don’t import often. |
| `importTimingSetter` | **required** Utility used to build the cron expression. |

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<RSS aggregator name>` |  |
| `data` | Data retrieved from the Internet. The content of this folder is that same for standard and planet feeds. This content is used for standard feed [components](#_feed_components) `(combinedFeedsParagraph` and `feedListParagraph` ) but not by the `planetFeed` component. See [Generating planet data](#_generating_planet_data) for more. |
| `channel-<number>` | A channel is created for each RSS feed. |
| `entry-<number>` | One entry in the feed such as one blog post. |
| `author` |  |
| `channelTitle` |  |
| `content` |  |
| …. |  |
| `description` | Feed properties retrieved from the internet. |
| `link` |  |
| …. |  |
| `automatedImport` | Internal feed properties. |
| `cron` |  |
| …. |  |

| Property | Description |

| `planet` | **required** Planet commands node. |
| `generatePlanetData` | **required** Generate planet data command node. |
| `class` | **required** info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.generator.PlanetDataGenerator : • Generates data for a planet feed. • Processes all feeds in the channel and creates an archive of feed items if the feed is marked as a planet feed. • Stores individual feed items in the planet archive and assigns `author` , `channelTitle` , `title` , `content` and `description` properties. Posts without these properties are not stored in the archive • Builds [checksums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) to eliminate duplicates. New items are only added if they don’t already exist in the archive. • Ensures that the maximum nodes allowed under a single node is not exceeded. • Respects any filters set. |
| `collectPlanetStatistics` | **required** Collect planet statistics command node. |
| `class` | **required** info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.generator.CollectStatisticsCommand : • Collects and generates statistics from feeds in a [Planetdatastorage](#_planet_data_storage) . • Stores the collected statistics in the JCR tree. |

| `feedGenerators` | **required** Feed generators node. |
| `<generator name>` | **required** Generator name. |
| `class` | **required** Generator class: • `rss` : info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.generator.RSSModuleFeedGenerator generates a `SyndFeed` based on [standard](#_creating_an_aggregate_feed) aggregation feeds. • `planet` : info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.generator.PlanetFeedGenerator generates a `SyndFeed` based on [planet](#_creating_an_aggregate_feed) aggregation feeds. • `category` : info.magnolia.module.categorization.syndication.CategorySyndicator is registered by the [Categorization module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Categorization-module/) . It generates a `SyndFeed` based on articles tagged with categories. • `templateContent` : info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.generator.PageSyndicator generates a `SyndFeed` based on template [types and subtypes](../../../Developing/Templating/Template-definition/Page-definition/) . ** Custom generators should extend the convenience base class info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.generator.AbstractSyndFeedGenerator . Subclasses need to implement the template methods `loadFeedEntries()` and `setFeedInfo(SyndFeed)` . | ** | Custom generators should extend the convenience base class info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.generator.AbstractSyndFeedGenerator .

| `FeedSyndicationServlet` | **required** Feed syndication servlet node. |
| `servletClass` | **required** info.magnolia.module.rssaggregator.servlet.FeedSyndicationServlet writes an XML feed to the response. Based on the request parameters, the `feedGenerators` [configuration](#_feed_generators) is resolved and used to generate the XML feed. The content of the feed is written to the response with the appropriate character encoding. |
