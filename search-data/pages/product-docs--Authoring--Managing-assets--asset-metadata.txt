# Asset metadata

The metadata fields are located in the Asset dialog. You can set metadata when uploading or add/edit it by clicking **Edit asset** to open the dialog.

The system records certain data automatically, with such fields typically disabled. By default, the following fields can’t be edited:

-   **Describe asset using**: The supported metadata standard. By default, the [Simple Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES)](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/) is supported. You can customize Magnolia to support different standards.

-   **Identifier**: An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context. An alphanumeric string is used to identify and reference the asset. Editors can move assets without breaking links in the DAM.

-   **Type**: The nature or genre of the resource.

-   **Creation Date**: Date of upload.

-   **Modification Date**: Date of last modification.

-   **Creator**: An entity responsible for creating the resource (uploading the asset).


## [](#_dublin_core_metadata)Dublin Core metadata

Magnolia supports the [Simple Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES)](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/) standard by default and the following fields are available:

-   **Caption**: The asset caption.

-   **Language**: Language tag of the asset. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as [RFC 4646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4646).

-   **Title**: Asset title.

-   **Subject**: The topic of the asset. Typically, the subject is represented using keywords, key phrases, or classification codes.

-   **Coverage**: Scope of the asset. Typically this refers to a place, period or jurisdiction.

-   **Description**: Full description of the asset.

-   **Publisher**: Original publisher of the asset if being republished from another source.

-   **Contributor**: Use to name asset contributors.

-   **Rights**: Type of copyright.

-   **Source**: A related asset from which this asset is derived.

-   **Relation**: Related assets.


## [](#_setting_alt_attributes)Setting alt attributes

The `alt` attribute of an `img` tag specifies alternative text (alt-text) for an image when that image can’t be displayed on a page. Its primary use is for accessibility purposes. For more, see [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#text-alternatives). Use concise text that serves the same function as the image when writing the alternative text.

The default alt-text comes from the image’s title field in the [Assets app](../../../Apps/List-of-apps/Assets-app/). However, if an **Alt-text** field is defined as part of a content app, the **Alt-text** field in the content app takes precedence.

Check alt-text with Developer tools

To double-check alt-text is added to your image, use the *Inspect* tool in your browser to see the structure of the page and look for the image info.

-   Assets app

-   Content app


If set in the Assets app and not explicitly defined in a content app, the image title serves as the alt-text.

If set in a content app, the field here takes precedence over the image title defined in the Assets app and serves as the alt-text.
