# Automatic backups

DX Cloud provides automatic backups as defined in the [values.yml file](#_values_yml_file) in your project. The backup sidecar is a container defined in the Magnolia Database (DB) pod of both the author and public workloads. The sidecar provides endpoints to list and create backups. In order to execute the endpoint, a port forward to the corresponding pod/container is required. The backup server is running on port `9999`.

> **Important:** Write ahead logging (WAL) must be enabled for the backup to work properly. It stores a base backup as well as the transaction logs.
