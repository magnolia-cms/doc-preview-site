## [](#_how_to_provide_good_seo_for_my_spa)How to provide good SEO for my SPA?

Because your public SPA is running completely outside of Magnolia, you should use whatever frontend delivery system makes the most sense for your team and project. We recommend some kind of SSR system such as [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Render](https://renderjs.nexedi.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), or your own. This is the best practice to have a SPA with good SEO crawlabilty.

## [](#_is_this_a_rad_app_builder)Is this a RAD App Builder?

Rapid Application Development (RAD) is an agile and rapid approach to building software with a strong focus on usability. It can be used to allow non-developers to assemble web apps & mobile apps in an intuitive way. However, it does not provide anything special to manage app state and events, that must be provided by your frontend project.

| **1** | `iframe` preview URL | Make sure your `iframe` preview URL in the [Pages app](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/concepts/content-modelling/#_pages_app) is correct. ** This should be the Author SPA with the correct path name and query parameters. | ** | This should be the Author SPA with the correct path name and query parameters. |
| ** | This should be the Author SPA with the correct path name and query parameters. |
| **2** | Correct environment | Make sure the Author SPA is fetching data from the correct environment, the Magnolia Author instance. ** It should fetch both the pages data and template annotations for the correct page. | ** | It should fetch both the pages data and template annotations for the correct page. |
| ** | It should fetch both the pages data and template annotations for the correct page. |
| **3** | Correct libraries | Ensure you’re using the latest [frontend libraries](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/magnolia-front-end-sdk/#_supported_framework_versions) . |
| **4** | HTML DOM comments | Check to see if there are any HTML comments in the DOM. • []() See comments? ** • []() Don’t see comments? ** Try running the `window.mgnlFrameReady()` function from inside the preview `iframe` to attempt to render the green bars. There could be a race condition [ [1](#_footnotedef_1) ] which essentially tries to render the bars before your site is ready. If this is the case, manually call `window.mgnlFrameReady()` : `function myFunction() { const element = document.querySelector('.mgnlEditorBar'); if (element) { clearInterval(intervalId); } else { window.mgnlFrameReady(); } } const intervalId = setInterval(myFunction, 200); (1)` ** **1** Where the time delay ( `200` ) is in milliseconds. The green bars are placed in the Page Editor based on the comments that the frontend places in the HTML using one of the [frontend libraries](../../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Developing/headless/spa-development/magnolia-front-end-sdk/#_supported_framework_versions) . It is **imperative** to have the HTML comments rendered. • Make sure the SPA fetches template annotations properly. It could be that it’s unaware it’s in the authoring context. • Make sure the call that the SPA makes can be run in incognito mode in your browser. Potentially, some security settings are preventing SPA from fetching template annotations. Check the console log • In your code, go to where you fetch the `template-annotations` . • Check the console log to ensure it’s working properly. `if (I_AM_INSIDE_MAGNOLIA) { (1) console.log('Hooray, I am here.') (2) console.log('I am trying to fetch:', 'MAGNOLIA/.rest/template-annotations/v1' + PATH_TO_NODE) (2) const templateAnnotationsRes = await fetch( 'MAGNOLIA/.rest/template-annotations/v1' + PATH_TO_NODE ); ... console.log('RESPONSE', templateAnnotations) }` ** **1** If the code runs successfully inside the `if` statement, then it is running in the correct context for the Pages app. ** **2** Print something along these lines to ensure the console log outputs the statement. This checks the correct URL is being used and you’re fetching from the correct Magnolia instance and page. ** If the response is okay, you should get the mappings for your HTML comments. [1](#_footnoteref_1) . A race condition is a situation when several processes or threads are attempting to access the same resource. | ** **1** | Where the time delay ( `200` ) is in milliseconds. | ** **1** | If the code runs successfully inside the `if` statement, then it is running in the correct context for the Pages app. | ** **2** | Print something along these lines to ensure the console log outputs the statement.
