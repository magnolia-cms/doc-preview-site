# Requesting localized content with the delivery endpoint

This page describes how you can request localized content with the Delivery endpoint API.

In Magnolia REST 2.1.x, version 2 of the Delivery endpoint allows you to send an API request for a specific language variant of content.

> **Warning:** For i18n features to work correctly, check that the fallback site has locales configured or extends a site definition with desired locales.

## [](#_specifying_the_language)Specifying the language

With the Delivery endpoint, you can request a *single* language variant, or send `lang=all` in the request to return *all* language variants available.

The format of value in the `lang` parameter for a specific variant depends on the `i18nContentSupport` class configured in your definition.

-   `info.magnolia.cms.i18n.IetfI18nContentSupport`: Use a dash (`-`) as a separator in the `lang` parameter (for example, `lang=de-DE`).

-   `info.magnolia.cms.i18n.DefaultI18nContentSupport`: Use an underscore (`_`) as a separator in the `lang` parameter (for example, `lang=de_DE`).


> **Note:** In Magnolia 6.2, DefaultI18nContentSupport worked with both underscore _ and dash -. Since Magnolia 6.3, only the underscore is supported.

To request a specific single language variant, do one of the following:

-   Set the [Accept-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) header. For example: `Accept-Language: de-DE`

-   Set the ``lang`query parameter. For example: `lang=de-DE``


If both are set, the lang parameter takes priority. If neither is set, the decision is delegated to [the I18nContentSupport interface](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Language/AdminCentral-and-public-locales/#_the_i18ncontentsupport_interface).

To return all language variants:

-   Set the `lang` query parameter to all: `lang=all`


> **Tip:** You can use both the Accept-Language header and the lang query parameter for both sub-resources Read node and Query nodes.

| Header | Request URL | JSON response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| not set | `/.rest/ep/travel/about` | JSON response: `{ "@name": "about", "@path": "/travel/about", "@id": "808ebe4c-72b2-49f1-b9f7-e7db22bce02f", "@nodeType": "mgnl:page", "hideInNav": "false", "title": "About", "@nodes": [] }` The language is not defined by the header or the lang parameter. The value returned for title is determined by the I18nContentSupport interface. |
