# Configuring domain redirect rules

This page explains how to configure a root domain redirect rule for your cloud-based Magnolia package. You can change your root domain to use different subdomains if so required. For example, you could redirect `www.abc.com` to `abc.com`.

> **Important:** Certificates for the domains you redirect from and to must be managed by Magnolia Cloud.
