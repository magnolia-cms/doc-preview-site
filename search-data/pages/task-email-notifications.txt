# Task Email Notifications module

The Task Email Notifications module module adds the ability to send emails to users which have a task waiting. This can be useful for publication requests. Users can receive email notifications from Magnolia about the task and its current state.

> **Warning:** The property nodeType on the listener configuration is overridden to use mgnl:task. It cannot be set to anything else.This module is independent from workflow or the publication command chain. It reacts to changes in the task workspace only.Email usernames containing dots does not work. See MGNLMAIL-105Correct configuration for sending mail through Gmail is unclear. See MGNLMAIL-104
