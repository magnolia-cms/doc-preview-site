# Configure packages

You can do the following configuration steps on an author instance.

-   [Create a new package](#_create_packages)

-   [Edit a package](#_edit_packages)

-   [Build a package](#_build_or_rebuild_packages)


Once you have created and built a package, it can be downloaded, uploaded, deleted, and imported on both author and public instances. See [Use packages](../usage/) for more details.

## [](#_create_packages)Create packages

You can create packages containing content from workspaces in Magnolia. One or more rule sets within a package definition define a package’s content. From the create package page, you can also build the package content once defined and download it to install it on another environment.

Follow the steps below to create a package:

1.  Open the Package Manager app.

2.  Click **\+ Create package**.

3.  On the New Package form, type in a package name and description.

4.  Click **\+ Rule set** to add [package definitions](#_example_package_definitions) to the new package.

    > **Caution:** When packaging content from the website workspace, remember to also package any assets from the assets workspace that are used on those pages.

5.  Click **Create Package**.

    You’re notified of the creation progress in the bottom left corner. It’s added to the top of the list of packages on the package browser tab.


| Scenario | Replace | Merge | Update |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Existing published page, untouched on the instance. | `DRAFT` | `PUBLISHED` (sometimes `MODIFIED` [ [1](#_footnotedef_1) ] ) | `PUBLISHED` (sometimes `MODIFIED` [ [1](#_footnotedef_1) ] ) |
| Component added to a page; you publish the page before building the package. | `DRAFT` | `MODIFIED` | `MODIFIED` |
| Component modified on the page; you publish the page after building the package. | `DRAFT` | `MODIFIED` | `MODIFIED` |
| Page doesn’t exist on the instance. | `DRAFT` | `DRAFT` | `DRAFT` |

## [](#_edit_packages)Edit packages

Editing a built or live package discards any built content. The package then returns to a draft state, and you must rebuild the package if you want to push it to an instance.

## [](#_build_or_rebuild_packages)Build or rebuild packages

Once you’ve defined a package with its workspace(s), root nodes, and filters, you can proceed to build it. Building a package generates a .zip file containing your content. The build process can be initiated either from the browser view or while editing the package. After a successful build, the package can then be pushed to an instance.

### [](#_build_while_editing_a_package)Build while editing a package

1.  Open the Package Manager app.

2.  Edit a package in the browser view.

    > **Note:** If you edit a package, you must rebuild it before you can download or import its contents. You can’t cancel a build process once it has started.

3.  Click **Build package**.

Want to look at built packages in the JCR?

Packages are created and built, then stored in the `packages` workspace in JCR. The `magnolia.packagemanager.storage.binaries.path` property defines the storage location for binaries when a package is built. By default, this is the instance’s root folder (for example, `/apache-tomcat/webapps/magnoliaAuthor/packmanBinaries`).
