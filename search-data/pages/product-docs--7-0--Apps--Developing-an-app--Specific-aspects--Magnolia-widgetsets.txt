# Magnolia widgetsets

This page describes the function of a widgetset, widgetset types provided by Magnolia and how you can use a custom widgetset.

## [](#_widgetset_basics)Widgetset basics

> A Vaadin [WidgetSet](http://dev.vaadin.com/wiki/WidgetSet) is a GWT module that ties together client side component implementations used by a particular Vaadin application. It is the part of the client side terminal that creates components from UIDL messages generated by the server side. ([WidgetSet – Vaadin](http://dev.vaadin.com/wiki/WidgetSet))

Things important to know about widgetsets:

-   In any GWT or Vaadin application, there can be only one widgetset. Since Magnolia’s admin UI is a Vaadin application, Magnolia can have only one widgetset. Therefore, it should inherit all the widgetsets you intend to use.

-   A custom widgetset for Magnolia must always inherit Magnolia’s default `info.magnolia.widgetset.MagnoliaWidgetSet` or any other widgetset which inherits from it.

-   A widgetset must always be GWT-compiled before you run your Web application, and it has to be recompiled every time the client-side code changes or when you add a new Vaadin add-on.


For further information about Vaadin [client-side development](https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/clientside/clientside-overview.html) and ways to [compile the widgetset](https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/clientside/clientside-compiling.html), see the [Book of Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/index.html) or the [GWT project](http://www.gwtproject.org/overview.html) website.

| Identifier | Description | Provided by the module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `info.magnolia.widgetset.MagnoliaWidgetSet` | Default Magnolia widgetset for CE bundles | [magnolia-vaadin-widgetset](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/platform/widgetset/-/tree/master) |
| `info.magnolia.widgetset.MagnoliaProWidgetSet` | Default Magnolia widgetset for DX Core bundles | [magnolia-vaadin-widgetset-pro](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/platform/widgetset-pro/-/tree/master) |

## [](#_setting_the_widgetset_property)Setting the widgetset property

The widgetset you intend to use has to be defined *per webapp* with the `magnolia.ui.vaadin.widgetset` property. Change the following entry in
`{your-webapp}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/config/default/magnolia.properties` :

For CE bundles:

magnolia.properties

```bash
magnolia.ui.vaadin.widgetset=info.magnolia.widgetset.MagnoliaWidgetSet
```

For DX Core bundles:

magnolia.properties

```bash
magnolia.ui.vaadin.widgetset=info.magnolia.widgetset.MagnoliaProWidgetSet
```

[Preconfigured Magnolia webapps and bundles](../../../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/#_list_of_preconfigured_magnolia_bundles) typically already come with a proper widgetset configuration.

## [](#_using_a_custom_widgetset)Using a custom widgetset

To add custom widgets or Vaadin addons to your Magnolia app, you need to provide a new widgetset. This means that you need to compile the new widgetset and configure Magnolia to use it.

Your custom widgetset must inherit from a Magnolia’s widgetset.

Once your widgetset has been compiled, tell Magnolia to use it by setting the `magnolia.ui.vaadin.widgetset` property accordingly. The expected value is a widgetset-qualified name in the format that Vaadin expects, without the `.gwt.xml` extension, for example `some.vaadin.package.SomeWidgetset`.

### [](#_a_recommended_setup)A recommended setup

1.  The default Magnolia Vaadin widgetset is extracted out of the Magnolia UI project to its own module.

2.  This module is brought in as a dependency of the bundle.


There are two key reasons for doing that:

-   Any of our Magnolia modules may bring its own client-side code or additional Vaadin add-ons.

-   We isolate the resource-intensive GWT compilation to a dedicated maven module, hence no longer affecting build time and stability of the Java code base.

    -   The resulting module only consists of two files: the *widgetset.gwt.xml* file and the Maven POM — with appropriate settings for the *vaadin-maven-plugin*.



What this means for your project is that you can leverage the exact same approach to integrate Magnolia’s default widgetset with your custom client-side widgets or Vaadin add-ons. This helps keep your dependencies and client-side code in the modules where they belong, while giving you more flexibility to integrate third-party modules along the way.
