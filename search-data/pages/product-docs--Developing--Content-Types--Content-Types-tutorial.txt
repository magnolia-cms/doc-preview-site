# Content Types tutorial

This two-part tutorial explains how to use Magnolia content types. Over the course of the tutorial, we create content type definitions and corresponding apps to manage data for *tour guides*, *tour offices* and *tour vehicles* for a hypothetical travel agency.

-   [Part I](Part-I-My-first-content-type/) leads you through installing Magnolia and creating a light module called `content-type-examples`. You will learn JCR basics and create your first content type `tourGuides` and an app.

-   [Part II](Part-II-Complex-content-types-and-security-set-up/) extends the use case by adding two more content types `tourOffices` and `tourVehicles`. You will extend the content types with submodels, define relations between different content types, link other apps, localize content items and learn how to adjust the security settings for a production environment.
