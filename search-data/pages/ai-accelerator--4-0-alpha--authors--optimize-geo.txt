# Optimize for AI search engines

Generates AI-optimized structured data for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), including JSON-LD schema, voice summaries, FAQs, and entity mentions to improve visibility in AI search engines and voice assistants.

> **Note:** Supports multilingual sites and automatically detects content changes to optimize API usage.

## [](#_usage)Usage

Once the Optimize GEO feature is activated, go to the **Pages** app and select a page. In the action bar, click **Optimize GEO** to generate AI-optimized structured data for the page.

The feature analyzes your page content and automatically generates:

-   **JSON-LD structured data** - Schema.org markup for AI search engines

-   **Voice summary** - A 40-60 word summary optimized for voice assistants

-   **FAQs** - Relevant questions and answers based on your content

-   **Entity mentions** - Links to Wikipedia for entities mentioned in your content


## [](#_what_gets_optimized)What gets optimized

The AI analyzes your page content in order of importance:

1.  Meta information (title, description, keywords)

2.  Main headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.)

3.  Body text content


It then generates structured data that helps AI search engines like Google SGE, Bing Chat, and Perplexity understand your content better and provide more accurate answers to user queries.

## [](#_generated_data)Generated data

The optimization creates several types of structured data:

-   **WebPage schema** - With speakable markup for voice search

-   **FAQPage schema** - With relevant Q&A pairs from your content

-   **Entity information** - Links to authoritative sources (such as Wikipedia) for entities mentioned


## [](#_multilingual_support)Multilingual support

The feature automatically detects the language of your content and generates structured data in the same language, making it suitable for multilingual websites.

## [](#_when_to_use)When to use

Use GEO optimization when you want to:

-   Improve visibility in AI-powered search results

-   Optimize content for voice search queries

-   Provide structured data for AI chatbots and assistants

-   Stay ahead of traditional SEO with AI-ready content


The feature automatically detects if your content has changed and only regenerates the structured data when necessary, saving API tokens and ensuring efficiency.
