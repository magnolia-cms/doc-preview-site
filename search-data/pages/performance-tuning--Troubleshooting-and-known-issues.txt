# Troubleshooting and known issues

## [](#_overview)Overview

This troubleshooting section identifies common performance issues and their resolutions. Additionally, it provides information on tools for profiling and diagnosing performance problems.

Tuning tips - Troubleshooting and known issues

-   **Debugging**

    -   Log the time it takes to fulfill the requests.

        For more, see [Performance test](Debugging-package/#_performance_test).


-   **Publishing errors**

    -   Debug the publishing process, inspecting what’s publishing in each step by turning the `XAReceiveFilter` to `DEBUG`.

    -   Resolve any locked nodes when publishing content.

        For more, see [Publishing issues](Publishing-errors/).


-   **Known issues**

    -   Limit the number of child nodes to a few hundred or less at each level to ensure smooth performance.

    -   High memory usage when bootstrapping content on the first startup.

    -   Increase the system-wide limit on the number of open files if the maximum number of file handles is exceeded for embedded Derby database users.

        For more, see [Known issues](Known-issues/).
