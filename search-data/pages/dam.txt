# DAM

[Digital asset management (DAM)](../product-docs/7.0/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) Bundled: Community edition Version 6.0.1 [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/7.0/) compatible

## [](#_about_dam)About DAM

The DAM module is the key component of the wider [DAM functionality](../product-docs/7.0/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) offered by Magnolia, providing the DAM API and its implementation. It is always used with the [dam-app:ROOT:index.adoc](#dam-app:ROOT:index.adoc), which provides the applications that are built on top of these APIs. For other module dependencies, see the [compatibility matrix](changelog/#_compatibility_matrix).

> **Note:** DAM 5 and DAM 6 provide almost identical functionality and code. The deciding factor for which version to use is the version of Magnolia you’re running.DAM 5.O is compatible with Magnolia 6.3 and requires an opt-in approach. In Magnolia 6.3, DAM 4.x remains the default.DAM 6.0 is compatible with Magnolia 6.4, is the default in version 6.4, and follows the 6.4 lifecycle.

## [](#_decoupled_asset_binary_and_metadata_storage)Decoupled asset binary and metadata storage

In DAM module 5.0 and later, Magnolia decouples asset binary and metadata storage, allowing binaries to be stored in AWS S3 while keeping metadata in the [`dam` JCR workspace](developers/dam-workspace/). This approach reduces the size of the JCR, speeds up publishing, and enhances search capabilities due to optimized metadata storage.

For S3 configuration information, see the [DAM JCR S3 submodule page](developers/dam-jcr-s3/).

Decoupling metadata and binary storage benefits customers who:

-   Work with many assets or large assets, such as videos or high-resolution images, that don’t fit efficiently in JCR

-   Need to store assets externally in a system that doesn’t support full metadata management

-   Use external storage solutions that are incompatible with the full [DAM API](developers/dam-api/)


The different storage methods don’t impact how authors [use assets](../product-docs/7.0/Authoring/Managing-assets/) in the Magnolia AdminCentral UI.

For an overview of DAM features available in Magnolia, see the [Digital asset management (DAM)](../product-docs/7.0/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) feature page.

See the [DAM API](developers/dam-api/) for developer-oriented information on extending functionality.
