# Enabling versioning in content apps

Magnolia versions pages, assets and contacts by default when they are [published](../../../../Authoring/Publishing/) and unpublished. You can also configure versioning for any other content type.

> **Tip:** A fresh Magnolia installation does not have versioned content. Demo content is bootstrapped and immediately marked as published. You see a green publication status icon but no publication has actually happened.

## [](#_diff_implementation)Diff implementation

Version comparison relies on functionality provided by the [Diff module](../../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Diff-module/). The module uses the [daisydiff](http://code.google.com/p/daisydiff/) java library to compare HTML files.

See [Diff configuration](../../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Diff-module/#_configuration).
