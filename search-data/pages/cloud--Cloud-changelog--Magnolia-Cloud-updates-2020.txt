## [](#_may)May

### [](#_magnolia_6_2_1)Magnolia 6.2.1

With this update, you can use Magnolia CMS 6.2.1 when [setting up your environments](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Setting-up-a-new-environment/) in the cloud.

> **Note:** We urge all cloud customers to upgrade their projects to use the latest Magnolia LTS release within 60 days of the version release date. All new deployments must be based on the latest LTS version of Magnolia.

Release notes for [Magnolia CMS 6.2.1](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Releases/Release-notes-for-Magnolia-CMS-6.2.1.adoc) are available.

### [](#_magnolia_cloud_magnolia_properties_file_conventions)Magnolia Cloud `magnolia.properties` file conventions

Applies to [\_custom cloud bundle](../../Supported-modules-in-the-cloud/#<em>cloud_bundle) implementations only.

From Magnolia 6.2.1, Magnolia provides a [cloud-specific option](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/build/maven-archetypes/-/blob/master/magnolia-cloud-project-archetype/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/README.md) in the [Magnolia Maven Archetype](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Development-how-tos/How-to-use-Magnolia-Maven-archetypes/) to facilitate the creation of your cloud bundles.

The Magnolia Maven Archetype generates a best-practice project skeleton. The Magnolia Cloud Maven Plugin validates and uploads your custom cloud bundle.

                        └── README.md
                        └── magnolia.properties

NOTE:

-   Two default profiles are generated: `dev` and `shared`. These profiles have their own `magnolia.properties` files.

-   During packaging, the `dev` profile is excluded. The `shared` profile is included and deployed to Magnolia Cloud.

-   You can add local developer credentials to the `dev` profile to be used instead of the typical Magnolia superuser/superuser, which is [disabled in the cloud](../../Onboarding-to-Magnolia-Cloud/Cloud-user-management/).

-   In the `shared` profile, you can create specific `.properties` files for each cloud environment. This can be used, for example, to test the integration of a third-party tool in the UAT environment without affecting your Live environment.


Make sure you use the latest version of the Magnolia Cloud Maven Plugin when deploying a new bundle to Magnolia Cloud: v1.0-RC6.

> **Warning:** If you previously created a custom bundle with .properties or web.xml file changes, please check your customizations carefully and adhere to the structure shown above.

More information can be found in the readme here: [README](https://git.magnolia-cms.com/projects/OD/repos/magnolia-cloud-maven-plugin/browse/README.md)

### [](#_magnolia_6_2_lts_release)Magnolia 6.2 (LTS release)

With this update, you can use Magnolia CMS 6.2 when [setting up your environments](../../Managing-environments-using-the-Magnolia-cockpit/Setting-up-a-new-environment/) in the cloud.

Release notes for [Magnolia CMS 6.2](#6.2@product-docs:ROOT:Releases/Release-notes-for-Magnolia-CMS-6.2.adoc) are available.

> **Note:** Magnolia 6.2 is an LTS release.

### [](#_self_service_deployment_of_java_customizations)Self-service deployment of Java customizations

Magnolia Cloud now supports self-service deployment of Java customizations. As a cloud customer, you or your chosen partner can deploy your custom Java code via our cloud self-service platform.

-   Streamlined and reduced deployment cycle

-   Upgrade anytime


This service is available for customers with a [custom cloud bundle](../../Supported-modules-in-the-cloud/#_custom_bundle_ndash_light_development_and_java_development).

### [](#_global_presence)Global presence

Previously all Magnolia deployments were based in Frankfurt where our main hosting center is. Now we have the possibility to deploy to other locations based on your project requirements. This offers:

-   Lowest latency possible for best customer experience

-   Enhanced compliance

-   Costs optimization


The region for your deployment should be discussed with Magnolia before your project starts. The region cannot be modified after Magnolia is already deployed.

### [](#_magnolia_6_1_5)Magnolia 6.1.5
