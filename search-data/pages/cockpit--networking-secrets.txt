# Secrets help

Secrets are sensitive data, like passwords or tokens, stored securely for certain tasks. These secrets securely authenticate Cockpit’s network operations. For example, they can be used for Ingresses. The secret types covered in this section are:

-   **Opaque**: Store custom credentials (e.g., API tokens).

-   **Registry**: Provide credentials for container registries.

-   **Basic Auth**: Set up HTTP Basic Authentication.
