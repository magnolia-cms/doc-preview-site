# Introduction

Magnolia’s architecture increasingly relies on RESTful APIs for both internal integration and external consumption. Our APIs provide access to content, configuration, and administrative functions. Designing high-quality, consistent APIs has become critical as we expand our platform capabilities and enable customers and partners to build integrations.

With this in mind, we’ve adopted "API First" as a key engineering principle. API development begins with a specification (OpenAPI) that is reviewed before implementation. API First fosters collaboration between teams and helps detect design issues early.

These guidelines ensure that our APIs:

-   are easy to understand and learn

-   are consistent with other Magnolia APIs

-   follow a consistent RESTful style and syntax

-   have predictable behavior and error handling

-   align with industry best practices (based on Zalando guidelines)


Ideally, all Magnolia APIs will look like they were designed by a single team.

## [](#conventions-used-in-these-guidelines)Conventions used in these guidelines

The requirement level keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" used in this document (case insensitive) are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## [](#rule-adoption-status)Rule adoption status

Rule titles are marked with severity labels (MUST, SHOULD, MAY). Status labels indicate how Magnolia applies each rule.

Each Zalando rule is classified with one of the following statuses:

-   **Adopted** – Follow the Zalando rule as-is

-   **Skipped** – Do not enforce (with rationale documented)

-   **Customized** – Modified for Magnolia conventions


See [Rule Mapping](../rules/rule-mapping.adoc) for the complete rule inventory.

## [](#magnolia-specific-information)Magnolia specific information

The purpose of these "RESTful API guidelines" is to define standards to establish "consistent API look and feel" quality across Magnolia products. Teams are responsible for fulfilling these guidelines during API development and are encouraged to contribute to guideline evolution via pull requests.

These guidelines will, to some extent, remain work in progress as our work evolves, but teams can confidently follow and trust them.

In case guidelines are changing, the following rules apply:

-   existing APIs don’t have to be changed, but we recommend it

-   clients of existing APIs have to cope with these APIs based on outdated rules

-   new APIs have to respect the current guidelines


Furthermore, you should keep in mind that once an API becomes publicly available, it has to be re-reviewed and changed according to current guidelines for sake of overall consistency.
