# imgfn

[FreeMarker development only](../../../Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia)

The imgfn templating function provides helpers for rendering and manipulating images in Magnolia templates.

`imgfn` templating functions provide useful functions for handling image resources stored in any workspace. They are commonly used to resolve [image variations](../../../Theme/#_image_variations).

`imgfn` templating functions are provided by the [Imaging module](../../../../../../../imaging/).

Magnolia recommends you store images in the DAM workspace and use [`damfn`](../damfn/) templating functions instead to benefit from the [DAM API](../../../../API/Java-Server-APIs/DAM-API/) (see [How to work with images using `damfn`](../../How-to-work-with-images/How-to-work-with-images-using-damfn/)).

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `binaryContent` | **required** Either the ContentMap or the Node of the binary you want to render. |
| `variation` | **optional** An image variation defined in the site [theme](../../../Theme/) . `original` if you want the original size of the image. |
