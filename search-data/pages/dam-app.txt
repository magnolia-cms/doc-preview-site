# DAM App

[Digital asset management (DAM)](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/use-cases/Digital-asset-management/) Bundled: Community edition Version 6.0.1 [Magnolia 6.4](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/) compatible

The [DAM App module](../dam/) provides the Assets app, a container application that hosts asset management subapps. The subapps displayed in the Assets app depend on which modules are installed:

-   *Magnolia Assets subapp*: The `dam-app-jcr` submodule installs this subapp for native JCR-based asset storage. With DAM 6, you can optionally [migrate](../dam/migrate/migrate/) binaries to external storage, such as AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage, while keeping metadata in JCR.

-   *External DAM subapps*: Connectors such as Amazon S3 or Bynder install these subapps through the [DAM integration framework](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/extensions-and-frameworks/external-dam-integration-framework/).


Each submodule decorates the Assets app, automatically adding its subapp to store and manage digital assets such as images, videos, and documents. Users can organize assets, edit images, apply automatic tags through image recognition, and manage metadata with support for the Dublin Core standard. Access control ensures proper permissions for all asset operations.

Storing assets centrally means updating an asset, which automatically updates all instances where it appears. This ensures consistency across multiple websites and simplifies content management. Standardized metadata fields help maintain structured content management.

Developers can extend functionality using the [DAM API](../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/API/Java-Server-APIs/DAM-API/).
