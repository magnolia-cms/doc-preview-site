# Known issues

## [](#_processing_parameters_in_a_model_class)Processing parameters in a model class

When creating your own model class to merge content and templates for rendering, take care when [populating the model with request attributes](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Developing/Templating/Rendering-content/#_processing_the_parameter_in_a_model_class).

Populating the rendering model with request attributes impacts performance. The rendering calculation takes about 8% longer when population is enabled. Enable it only for templates where it is really needed.

## [](#_collecting_referencing_nodes_is_slow)Collecting referencing nodes is slow

When deleting nodes, the [content dependencies module](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Dependencies-module/) checks for references to them. These checks result in a query for each node. Lucene must allocate memory to process the queries' indexes, which causes a lot of GC pressure.

For more, see [MGNLCDEP-138](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLCDEP-138).

## [](#_too_many_same_level_jcr_entries)Too many same-level JCR entries

In JCR (Java Content Repository) and the Jackrabbit implementation of JCR, there’s no hard limit on the number of items that can exist at one level. However, the performance of the repository may degrade as the number of child items at a particular level increases.

The optimal number of child nodes per level depends on many factors, including the specific use case and the performance characteristics of the underlying storage system.

In general, for smooth performance, it’s recommended to limit the number of child nodes to a few hundred or less at each level.

For more, see [JCR workspace: Best practices](../../Content-structure-and-organization/Structuring-jcr-workspace/#_best_practices).

> **Tip:** You can still retrieve the tree structure as a list through, for example, search templating functions.Using a balanced tree structure, you can mitigate performance issues when publishing hundreds of items at once. See the itemsPerRequest property of the publish command.

> **Note:** See also Q. I have too many child nodes and performance goes down (Apache Jackrabbit Wiki).

## [](#_high_memory_usage_when_bootstrapping_content_on_first_startup)High memory usage when bootstrapping content on first startup

When importing content on first startup or installation, you may experience high memory usage or even an `OutOfMemoryError` (OOME) exception. The reason is that Jackrabbit keeps all changes in a transient space (and hence in memory) until the session is saved.

If the `Unable to complete bootstrapping: out of memory.` message is displayed, try to increase the maximum Java heap size with the `-Xmx` parameter in the server startup script.

> **Note:** You can also alleviate the issue by disabling the Jackrabbit search index for the import (commenting out the Magnolia index configuration in the workspace.xml configuration file(s)).

> **Tip:** Although Magnolia provides generic indexing capabilities for the content data under JCR, you may need to modify the different namespaces with custom configurations. To configure specific indexing capabilities for your JCR content types, you can follow the guidelines on index rules to generate custom index rules.

## [](#_directorywatcher_overflow)DirectoryWatcher overflow

A `DirectoryWatcher` overflow warning can help you pinpoint the roots of an overflow. It is logged when there are more than 500 configured virtual URI mappings in light modules.

If a `DirectoryWatcher` overflow error occurs ([MAGNOLIA-7762](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-7762)), try to:

-   Keep the number of files in a single folder below 100.

-   Use folder hierarchies whenever possible.

## [](#_slow_admincentral_with_many_tasks_and_notifications)Slow AdminCentral with many tasks and notifications

AdminCentral might get slow over time. One of the possible causes – especially when there’s no log indication of any specific issue – is a high number of [tasks](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Features/Tasks/) and [notifications](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/Developing-an-app/Specific-aspects/Messages/Message-types/#_notification) stored in the user profile.

You can check the total number of tasks and notifications using the [Tasks](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Tasks-app/) and [Notifications](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/List-of-apps/Notifications-app/) apps, respectively.

> **Warning:** You should not experience performance issues unless more than several thousand items are stored in your profile.

Tasks and notifications are aggregated by [group](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Administration/IAM/Roles-groups-and-users/#_default_groups). If a person belonging to the `editors` group deletes all items, this action will impact all others in that group.

Finally, remember to check all author instances for a high number of items (production, UAT/QA, development and others).

> **Note:** If multiple users are experiencing performance issues, each should check the number of tasks and notifications and resolve or delete all non-essential items.

## [](#_slow_admincentral_with_multiple_editors)Slow AdminCentral with multiple editors

Concurrent access to the JCR might require a bigger Jackrabbit cache size. To adjust the default 16 MB, add the following parameters to your JVM configuration. They will increase the cache size to 256 MB:

```bash
-Dorg.apache.jackrabbit.maxCacheMemory=268435456
-Dorg.apache.jackrabbit.minMemoryPerCache=1048576
-Dorg.apache.jackrabbit.maxMemoryPerCache=67108864
```

> **Note:** Memory is allocated from the Java heap.

## [](#_slow_browser_subapp_due_to_multiple_operations_triggering_workspace_observation)Slow browser subapp due to multiple operations triggering workspace observation

Many users creating many items in a workspace concurrently causes many observation events. Too many observation events in a short period of time could make the grid in the browser subapp nearly unusable. Configuring the observation mechanism is possible by changing delays for processing events or even disabling it completely.

Turning the automatic observation property off would mean no automatic browser subapp refreshing, but only when a user performs some action. Reducing the number of observation events reduces the number of updates to the grid, making it more reactive. At the same time, the grid will be less up-to-date with changes made by other users.

See [JCR observation definition](../../../product-docs/RNs-6-4-3/Apps/App-configuration/Data-source-definition/JCR-data-source/JCR-observation-definition/) for more information.
