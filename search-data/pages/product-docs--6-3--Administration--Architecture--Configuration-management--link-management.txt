# Link management

Configure Magnolia to standardize how URLs are generated so your pages use a consistent format and avoid duplicate URL variants.

You may prefer URLs that end with a trailing slash rather than file extensions like `.html` or `.jsp`, so that your site consistently uses a single URL style and avoids search engines treating different variants as separate pages. Also, configuring trailing slashes allows for automated redirects and canonical tags, ensuring consistent links for better ranking and link equity.

## [](#_configure_link_management)Configure link management

Follow the instructions in this section to generate URLs that consistently end with a trailing slash. First, choose an approach to configuring link management:

-   Bootstrap the configuration before startup.

    Use this option when you want the setting to be present at startup, for example, when installing new instances.

-   Adjust the configuration after startup using the Configuration app.

    Use this option when you already have a running instance and want to adjust link management without restarting or applying a bootstrap file.


-   Bootstrapped configuration before startup

-   Configuration after startup


Place the following bootstrap file in a Magnolia bootstrap folder before startup. Set the value of `appendTrailingSlash` to `true` to ensure that any generated URL links in Magnolia end with `/`.

<YOUR\_MODULE>/src/main/resources/mgnl-bootstrap/core/config.server.rendering.linkManagement.xml

```xml
 </sv:property>
  <sv:property sv:name="appendTrailingSlash" sv:type="Boolean">
    <sv:value>true</sv:value>
   </sv:property>
```

Add the `appendTrailingSlash` property and set it to `true` using the Configuration app.
