# Init command for project initialization

The `init` command initializes a Magnolia CLI project in your current directory. It automatically detects your project type and configures the necessary files and dependencies.

## [](#_running_the_command)Running the command

In your project directory, run:

```console
npx @magnolia/cli@latest init
```

The command does the following steps:

-   Detect the project type.

-   Create or validate the `package.json` with `"type": "module"`.

-   Install the `@magnolia/cli` as a dependency.

-   Add the `"mgnl": "node node_modules/@magnolia/cli"` script.

-   Create the `mgnl.config.js` (or `mgnl.config.mjs`, for CommonJS projects),

-   For Headless Accelerator projects: Run `ha install` if available.


> **Caution:** For Headless Accelerator projects, ensure that the ha-cli and ha commands are installed. For more details, see the HA Documentation.

> **Note:** If your project has already been initialized, the command detects this and exits without making any changes.

## [](#_next_steps)Next steps

After the initialization:

1.  Browse the [available plugins](../../plugins/) to find the ones you need.

2.  Add plugins: `npm run mgnl — add-plugin <plugin-name>`.

3.  Run CLI commands as needed.


| Error type | How to fix |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid `package.json` | Fix the syntax errors before running the `init` again. |
| `mgnl.config.js` file errors | Review and fix import or syntax errors in your config file. |
| Headless Accelerator setup failures | Run `ha install` manually if needed. For more details, see the [HA Documentation](https://ha.magnolia-cms.com/) |
