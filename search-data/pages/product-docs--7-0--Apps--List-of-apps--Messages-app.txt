# Messages app

The Messages app allows users to send messages to each other via the Notifications app. They can send messages to individual users, groups or all users. An administrator can use the app to notify users of upcoming system outages, for example.

## [](#_configuration)Configuration

The Messages app is installed by the [Messages App module](../../../Modules/List-of-modules/Messages-App-module/). Access to the app is restricted to the `superuser` role in the app configuration and [app launcher layout](../../../Administration/App-Launcher/App-launcher-layout/). The app is configured in `/modules/messages-app/apps/messages`.
