# Container

The Container component is a layout component used to organize content into columns or rows. Each item acts as a section where available components can be placed.

## [](#_preview)Preview

## [](#_fields)Fields

-   `container` (required, default: `columns`) - A switchable field to define layout direction:

    -   `columns` - Lays out content in vertical columns.

    -   `rows` - Lays out content in horizontal rows.


-   `count` (required, default: 3) - Number of layout sections:

    -   Radio buttons from 1 to 5.

    -   Represents the number of columns or rows based on the value of the `container` field.



## [](#_behavior)Behavior

-   User must select either rows or columns.

-   Based on the selected layout direction:

    -   If `columns` is selected, child components will be displayed in equally divided vertical columns.

    -   If `rows` is selected, child components will be stacked horizontally in equal rows.


-   Components can be added to each column or row area individually.
