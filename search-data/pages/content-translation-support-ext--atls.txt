### [](#_how_it_works)How it works

The same steps with CTSX Google Translator but you will choose "Sync Atls Translate" or "Async Atls Translate" instead of "Google.com" in the Configuration depending on whether you want a synchronous or asynchronous translation.

> **Note:** In addition, if you have chosen an asynchronous translation, at "Step 2" after submitting the batch you must wait for the response from AT Language Solutions translator.

You would be able to see the Task notification for translation result as soon as the submission has been delivered.
