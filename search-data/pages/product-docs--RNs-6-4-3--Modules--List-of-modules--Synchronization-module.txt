## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../../Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.synchronization</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-synchronization</artifactId>
  <version>{magnolia-synchronization-64}</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Should you need to specify the module version, do it using `<version>`. |

To be able to use the Sync Instance app, add also the following module:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.synchronization</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-synchronization-app</artifactId>
  <version>{magnolia-synchronization-64}</version> (1)
</dependency>
```

## [](#_use_cases)Use cases

### [](#_public_instance_failure)Public instance failure

Imagine that you have two public Magnolia instances. Due to hardware failure, one of them is out of operation. As you try to publish content during the outage, [transactional publishing](../Publishing-Transactional-module/) tells you that the content can’t be published because one of the public instances is down.

Since you really need to publish new content to the remaining public instance, you make a conscious decision to switch off the receiver that suffered the hardware failure. Now you can publish the content while waiting for the failed hardware to be replaced.

A few days later hardware on the failed public instance has been replaced and the server is up again. You re-enable the receiver so that all new content is published to both public instances. But you still have a problem with what to do with all the content that was published while the instance was down. Your options are:

-   Republish everything to both instances. This is a time-consuming process, generates high load, and slows down your site during publishing.

-   If you kept a list of the published pages, you know exactly what to publish to get them on both instances. This works well for small deployments with infrequent updates and a single editor.

-   Use the Synchronization module. Set the previously broken public instance as a synchronization receiver and Magnolia will take care of syncing the missing content.


### [](#_public_instance_blackout)Public instance blackout

All public instances are corrupted, broken or compromised. No instances exist to serve content. A small site can deal with this by creating a new public instance and publishing all content to it. This is difficult in large deployments that have many editors, where content has already been modified since the blackout took effect, and where some pages aren’t yet ready to be published across the site. Use the Synchronization module to publish any previously published versions of content, even if the content was modified further, and skip any pages that weren’t previously published.

### [](#_high_load)High load

You have a sudden high load on your site. You need to add a new public instance to deal with the load.

-   You can’t shut down any of the existing public instances because you need them to deal with the load. This prevents taking a snapshot for cloning.

-   You can’t publish all content from the author instance to public instances since this would unnecessarily flush the cache on them and increase load when the servers are already busy.


The solution is to create a new empty public instance and use the Synchronization module to publish content only to that instance while the existing public instances keep serving content.
