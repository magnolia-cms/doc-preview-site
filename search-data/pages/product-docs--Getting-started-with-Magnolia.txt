# Getting started with Magnolia

Welcome! If you’re new to Magnolia and want to get started, this is the right place to begin. This page covers starter topics for Magnolia DX Core, which is the on-premise version of Magnolia. If you’re looking for the platform-as-a-service option, check out [DX Cloud documentation](../../paas/).

Magnolia is an enterprise-grade **Digital Experience Platform DXP** \[[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")\] that allows you to build flexible and fast solutions for demanding multi-channel, multi-language, and multi-site digital experiences. Magnolia’s modular architecture is well-suited for building industry-specific solutions that require scalability, reliability and excellent support.

With Magnolia DXP, you’ll benefit from quick project delivery, WYSIWYG integration with Single Page Applications via the SPA editor, a wide range of out-of-the-box integrations, and vertically-focused integration frameworks that enable integration with all tools in the adjacent industries.
