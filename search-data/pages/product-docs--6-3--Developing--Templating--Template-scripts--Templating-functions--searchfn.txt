# searchfn

[FreeMarker development only](../../../Renderers/#_renderers_provided_by_magnolia)

`searchfn` templating functions allow you to search pages - or more generally content - returning collections of [ContentMap](../Templating-function-arguments-and-return-types/#_info.magnolia.jcr.util.contentmap) objects.

The results are sorted by `jcr:score()`, descending. A text excerpt may be available in the returned ContentMap depending on how Jackrabbit search is configured. Magnolia checks the current user’s permissions before adding a result to the collection.
