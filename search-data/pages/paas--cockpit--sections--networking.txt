# Networking

The **Networking** section of the Cockpit lets you create and manage ingresses and certificates, handle redirects and configure your desired redirect settings, and manage secrets.

## [](#_select_desired_cluster)Select desired cluster

Select your desired cluster from the dropdown menu at the top of the Cockpit.

![select cluster id](../../_images/select-cluster-id.jpg)

## [](#_ingresses)Ingresses

Kubernetes Ingresses manage external access to services within a cluster, enabling HTTP and HTTPS traffic routing based on hostnames and paths. They provide a flexible, scalable way to expose Magnolia applications, supporting features like SSL termination, load balancing, and custom Nginx configurations. Ingresses are essential for delivering secure, performant web experiences in the DX Cloud Cockpit.

In this section, you can find:

-   [Instructions to add an Ingress in the Cockpit](#Add an Ingress)

    You can also find embedded help directly in the Cockpit.

-   [Claim an Ingress](#_claim_an_ingress)

-   [Synchronize an Ingress](#_synchronize_an_ingress)

-   [Learn important Ingress terms](#_ingress_terms)

### [](#_claim_an_ingress)Claim an Ingress

Claiming an Ingress designates the Cockpit as the primary tool for managing its configuration, ensuring that subsequent changes are made through the Cockpit and external updates (e.g., via Rancher or CI/CD pipelines) are ignored when publishing. Once claimed, the Cockpit’s, external changes are overwritten when publishing from the Cockpit. Only healthy ingresses, those without synchronization warnings, can be claimed and managed via the Cockpit.

> **Note:** After claiming an Ingress, ensure it is managed exclusively through the Cockpit to avoid conflicts.Changes made externally (e.g., in Rancher or via kubectl) may persist in the Kubernetes cluster until overwritten by a Cockpit publish, but they can cause synchronization issues or be lost.Establish clear ownership for each Ingress, choosing one management approach:the Cockpit recommended ✓a CI/CD pipeline (configuration as code)manual Kubernetes tools (e.g., Rancher, for rare cases).

To claim an Ingress:

1.  Go to **Networking > Ingresses**.

2.  Choose the desired Ingress.

3.  Under the details section click **Claim**.


#### [](#_validation_severity_levels)Validation Severity Levels

Ingress validation issues are categorized into two severity levels:

-   **Warnings** : These ingresses are functional but fail validation checks, preventing them from being claimed. Warnings indicate issues that must be resolved at the infrastructure level (e.g., via Rancher). After fixing the issues, trigger a [Synchronization](#_synchronize_an_ingress) in the Cockpit to revalidate the Ingress. If no synchornization warnings remain, the Ingress can be claimed. Attempting to claim an Ingress with synchronization warnings will result in an `HTTP 422` status code from the backend.

-   **Errors** : Ingresses with errors are non-functional and can be claimed to allow fixes directly in the Cockpit. Use the Cockpit interface to edit and resolve these errors, restoring the Ingress to a healthy state.


> **Tip:** To troubleshoot validation issues, check the Ingress details in the Cockpit or consult your Kubernetes management tool (e.g., Rancher) for specific error messages.

### [](#_synchronize_an_ingress)Synchronize an Ingress

Synchronization updates the Cockpit’s view of an unclaimed Ingress to reflect its current configuration in the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., managed via Rancher). Synchronization allows users to review the Ingress’s state in the Cockpit before deciding to claim it for Cockpit management. Synchronization is not available for claimed Ingresses, as claiming stops this process to ensure the Cockpit controls the Ingress’s configuration.

Ingresses created in the Cockpit are typically claimed and aligned with Kubernetes upon publishing, so synchronization is only needed if external changes or validation issues arise.

> **Caution:** Synchronization is only for unclaimed ingresses. After claiming an Ingress, the Cockpit manages the Ingress exclusively, and synchronization is disabled. External changes to a claimed Ingress (e.g., via Rancher) are not reflected in the Cockpit and are overwritten by a Cockpit publish.Manage claimed ingresses exclusively through the Cockpit to avoid issues.

#### [](#_why_synchronize)Why Synchronize?

Synchronization is used when:

-   You need to view the latest Kubernetes configuration of an unclaimed Ingress (e.g., created in Rancher or modified externally) in the Cockpit before claiming it.

-   Validation warnings have been fixed at the infrastructure level (e.g., in Rancher), and you need to revalidate an unclaimed Ingress to confirm it’s claimable.


> **Note:** Ingresses created in the Cockpit are typically claimed and synced with Kubernetes upon publishing, so synchronization is rarely needed unless external changes occur before claiming.Ingresses created in Rancher or other Kubernetes tools require synchronization to appear accurately in the Cockpit before claiming.

#### [](#_how_to_synchronize_an_ingress)How to synchronize an Ingress

To synchronize an Ingress:

1.  In the Cockpit, go to **Networking > Ingresses**.

2.  Select an unclaimed Ingress from the list.

3.  Verify that no unpublished changes exist in the Cockpit (e.g., check for pending edits in the Ingress details).

4.  Click the **Synchronize** button.


The Cockpit then pulls the Ingress’s current configuration from the Kubernetes cluster, updates its database, and revalidates the Ingress. If validation errors persist (e.g., resulting in an `HTTP 422` status code), resolve them at the infrastructure level and synchronize again.

##### [](#_best_practices)Best Practices

-   **Choose a management tool**: Decide whether an Ingress is managed via the Cockpit, a CI/CD pipeline, or manually (e.g., Rancher). Synchronize unclaimed ingresses to review their state, then claim them for Cockpit management if desired.

-   **Check before synchronizing**: Ensure no temporary Cockpit edits are critical, as they will be lost during synchronization.

-   **Synchronize selectively**: Use synchronization only when needed (e.g., to review external changes or revalidate warnings). After claiming, manage the Ingress exclusively via the Cockpit.

-   **Monitor Ingress health**: After synchronizing, check for validation warnings () or errors () in the Cockpit.

-   **Troubleshoot issues**: If synchronization fails, verify the Ingress configuration in Rancher or with `kubectl get Ingress` to identify discrepancies.

## [](#_manage_certificates)Manage certificates

You can manage your own certificates directly in the Cockpit under the **Networking** section. You can either choose to [add a managed certificate](#_managed) or [add a custom certificate](#_custom).

The **Networking > Certificates** section displays useful information in a table format including the certificate status, validity period, and whether or not the certificate is custom. You can also filter by Type, Method, and Status.

![certificate overview](../../_images/networking/certificates/certificate-overview.jpg)

### [](#_managed)Managed

Managed certificates involve fewer manual steps on your side. Once set up, we take care of everything, ensuring your certificate stays valid and up to date.

You have two options, including HTTP-01 which is the most straight forward option and DNS-01 which involves just a few minor steps. See the tabs below to decide which option is best for your DX Cloud project.

-   HTTP-01: Recommended

-   DNS-01


Triggers automatically if your [ingress](#_add_an_ingress) includes the `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` annotation (e.g., for [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)).

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod" (1)
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Specifies the issuer. Also, automatically triggers a managed certificate when applied. |

In this case, no DNS changes are required as it verifies via a temporary HTTP endpoint.

**Best for**: Simple setups where the domain is publicly accessible from port `80`.

You need to add the provided `CNAME` record to your domain’s DNS settings to prove ownership.

**Best for**: Wildcard certificates

### [](#_custom)Custom

You have more control with custom certificates. However, with more control comes more steps for you. You manage your certificate through a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

You’ll generate a CSR through the Cockpit, then use it to request a signed certificate from your Certificate Authority (CA).

Once you receive the signed certificate, upload it back into our Cockpit. From there, you retain full control over the certificate’s lifecycle, including renewals and updates.

See [Add certificate](#_add_certificate) for Cockpit instructions.

### [](#_add_certificate)Add certificate

This section provides guidance on adding both managed and custom certificates.

There are some limitations for certificates:

-   The maximum number of subdomains per domain is **100**.

-   The maximum subdomain and domain length combined is **250 characters**.

-   You should add a certificate with either a **RSA 2048**, **RSA 4096**, **EC P-256**, or **EC P-384** key.

-   You can use wildcards for custom certificates, which are handled as part of these instructions. However, if using [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), you must file a [Support request](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/13) for wildcard certificates.


#### [](#_managed_certificates)Managed certificates

View from the Cockpit

![add managed certificate](../../_images/networking/certificates/add-managed-certificate.jpg)

1.  Go to your Cockpit and navigate to **Networking > Certificates**.

2.  Click **Add certificate**.

3.  Click **Add managed certificate**.

4.  Give the certificate a **Name**. The name must match the Kubernetes resource naming scheme (e.g., `example-certificate`).

    *Names must start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`) only.*

5.  Select the **Key size** for your certificate.

    Key sizes explained

    -   **RSA 2048**: Widely used encryption standard that provides strong security and is considered suitable for most applications today.
        If you’re using Fastly as your CDN, you must add a certificate with a **2048-bit RSA key** as Fastly does not support 4096-bit RSA keys.

    -   **RSA 4096**: Offers a higher level of security than a 2048-bit key, though it requires more computational power and resources.

    -   **EC P-256**: Uses elliptic curve cryptography to provide equivalent security to a 3072-bit RSA key, offering strong security with lower computational overhead.

    -   **EC P-384**: Advanced elliptic curve option providing equivalent security to a 7680-bit RSA key, offering the highest level of security with optimal performance for demanding applications.


    If needed, you can modify the certificate algorithm later by going to [Change algorithm](#_change_algorithm) in the details section of your desired certificate in the Cockpit.

6.  Enter your **Domain** (e.g., `example.com`).

7.  Choose the **Issuer** from the dropdown menu.

    Currently, this is limited to [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

8.  Click **Add managed certificate**.

    -   If using HTTP-01 (via Ingress annotation), no further steps are needed.

    -   If using DNS-01, you need to verify ownership by [adding a `CNAME` to your DNS settings](#_verify_cname).



##### [](#_verify_cname)Verify CNAME

These steps only apply if you’re using [the DNS-01 approach](#_managed) for your certificate.

1.  Go to your Cockpit and navigate to **Networking > Certificates**.

2.  From the table, select your managed certificate.

3.  On the right, click the green circle with lines.

4.  Click **Verify CNAME**.

5.  In the dialog, copy the `CNAME`.

    Example

    ```none
    _acme-challenge.example.com. IN CNAME 1234beq2-1234-112A-3w21-12380ab31t2t.auth.host.com.
    ```

6.  Paste the `CNAME` into your DNS settings.


What does this do?

This allows Magnolia to verify you have control over the domain and delegate the resolution of ACME challenges, to our infrastructure.

The system constantly checks the presence of this record in the background. Keep the entry in your DNS as long as the domain should be managed by Magnolia. Automatic certificate issuance and renewal starts as soon as the record has been created.

##### [](#_change_algorithm)Change algorithm

You can change the algorithm (RSA, ECDSA) and key size of a Let’s Encrypt managed certificate through the Cockpit. This is useful if your organization requires stronger encryption or if you want to optimize performance with a more efficient algorithm.

> **Caution:** Changing the algorithm or key size always creates a new certificate and private key.

#### [](#_custom_certificates)Custom certificates

View from the Cockpit

![add custom certificate](../../_images/networking/certificates/add-custom-certificate.jpg)

1.  Go to your Cockpit and navigate to **Networking > Certificates**.

2.  Click **Add certificate**.

3.  Click **Add custom certificate**.

4.  Give the certificate a **Name**.

    *Names must start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`) only.*

5.  Select the **Key size** for your certificate.

    Key sizes explained

    -   **RSA 2048**: Widely used encryption standard that provides strong security and is considered suitable for most applications today.
        If you’re using Fastly as your CDN, you must add a certificate with a **2048-bit RSA key** as Fastly does not support 4096-bit RSA keys.

    -   **RSA 4096**: Offers a higher level of security than a 2048-bit key, though it requires more computational power and resources.

    -   **EC P-256**: Uses elliptic curve cryptography to provide equivalent security to a 3072-bit RSA key, offering strong security with lower computational overhead.

    -   **EC P-384**: Advanced elliptic curve option providing equivalent security to a 7680-bit RSA key, offering the highest level of security with optimal performance for demanding applications.


    If needed, you can modify the certificate algorithm later by going to [Change algorithm](#_change_algorithm) in the details section of your desired certificate in the Cockpit.

6.  Enter an **Alternative name** for your certificate. This will autofill the **Common Name**.

7.  If the common name is different than the Alternative name, enter the **Common Name** for your certificate.

    Important information on common names

    Common Name represents the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for which the certificate is being issued.

    This is critical as it specifies the exact domain name that the certificate will secure.

    For example, if a certificate is meant to secure "www.example.com" then the Common Name in the CSR should be "www.example.com".

    If the Common Name does not match the domain name, the certificate will not work correctly.

8.  Enter the Organization associated with the certificate.

    This is the full legal company or personal name. (such as *Magnolia International* or *Frolicking Fairies*)

9.  If applicable, provide the Organizational Unit name.

    **Example**: The Awesome Department

10.  Enter the Locality, the full city name.

     **Example**: Kilgarvan

11.  Enter the State, the full state name.

     **Example**: Kerry

12.  Enter the Country’s two letter code.

     **Example**: IE

13.  Click **Add custom certificate**.

     Since you added a custom certificate, you’ll need to [sign the certificate](#_sign_certificate).


#### [](#_sign_certificate)Sign certificate

You now need to paste in your signed certificate from your issuer.

1.  Go to your Cockpit and navigate to **Networking > Certificates**.

2.  From the table, select the certificate you want to sign.

3.  On the right, click the green circle with lines.

4.  Click **Install certificate**.

    1.  Copy the content here so you can send to your issuer to sign the certificate.

        > **Note:** When validating custom certificates, you have to include the entire certificate chain. Below is just an example to give you an idea on how that would look.

        Example request
