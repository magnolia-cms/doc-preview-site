## [](#_usage)Usage

Search results are ranked in the following order:

1.  Last used content

    If you’ve recently searched for something and clicked on a result, that result is prioritized and appears higher up in your search results the next time you perform a search.

2.  Most used content

    If no recent results are found, the system prioritizes content that you’ve interacted with frequently in the past. For example, if you previously clicked on a search result for a page titled `Swiss-cheese` multiple times, then it’s displayed at the top of the search results when you search for the word 'Swiss'.

3.  User group-based recommendations

    If neither recent nor frequently used content is available, the system considers recommendations from users in your user group (such as the 'editors' group). For example, if other editors have interacted with a page titled `Swiss-watch`, it’s displayed as the top result when you search for 'Swiss' for the first time.


The metrics collected by the User Result Ranker module are stored in the `userranking` [workspace](../../../../RNs-6-4-3/Administration/Architecture/Workspaces/).

### [](#_results_ranking_in_the_global_search)Results ranking in the Global Search

The [Global Search](../../../Authoring/Search/Global-search/)’s ranking functionality (Magnolia DX Core only) enhances search result relevance by leveraging this User Result Ranker module.

When a user selects a search result, the system records the item’s UUID and the current user (retrieved from the session, including their user group for collaborative ranking).

Results are ranked in order of preference:

-   Recently selected items appear highest.

-   Followed by frequently used content.

-   Finally, you see the recommendations based on the user’s group, for example, the editors.


This dynamic ranking, integrated with the React-based Global Search frontend, ensures a personalized and efficient search experience.

> **Note:** In the Community Edition (CE), ranking is disabled, and the score is always 0.
