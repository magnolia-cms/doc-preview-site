# Magnolia REST API Rule Mapping

Quick reference for all Zalando Zally rules and their Magnolia status.

Source of truth: `zally-ruleset-zalando` artifact (36 rules)

## [](#_legend)Legend

-   **ADOPT** – Follow the Zalando rule as-is

-   **SKIP** – Do not enforce (with rationale documented)

-   **CUSTOMIZE** – Modified for Magnolia conventions

-   **TBD** – Decision pending
