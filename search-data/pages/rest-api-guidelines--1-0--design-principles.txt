# REST Design – Design Principles

Documents design principles that **cannot** be enforced via OpenAPI specification validation alone. These are process, methodology, or runtime concerns that require human review or runtime checks.

> **Note:** Future custom Magnolia rules (M001-M007) will enforce some of these principles where technically feasible.

## [](#_process_and_methodology)Process and Methodology

### [](#100)Follow API first principle

API First means you start the development of an API with a specification (typically an OpenAPI specification) and review it thoroughly before writing any production code. This allows early review and feedback from all stakeholders, including client developers, architects, security experts, and operations.

API First also enables parallel work of frontend and backend teams, and helps to detect design issues early, before they become costly to fix.

> **Note:** This is a development process principle that cannot be validated by static analysis.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #100](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#100)

## [](#_data_format_principles)Data Format Principles

### [](#167)Use JSON as payload data interchange format

JSON must be used as the primary data interchange format for request and response payloads.

APIs must support `application/json` and ensure that payloads are encoded using UTF-8.

> **Note:** Partially enforced by Zally rule 172 (MediaTypesRule). Full JSON enforcement requires runtime validation.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #167](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#167)

## [](#_pagination_principles)Pagination Principles

The following pagination rules will be enforced by future custom Magnolia rules.

### [](#159)Use pagination

Access to lists of data items must support pagination to protect the service against overload as well as to support client-side iteration and batch processing experience.

This holds true for all lists that are (potentially) larger than just a few hundred entries.

> **Note:** Future custom rule M003 will enforce pagination parameters on collection endpoints.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #159](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#159)

### [](#248)Use pagination response page object

For iterating over collections (result sets) we recommend using offset-based pagination with a consistent response structure.

Magnolia pagination response structure:

-   `items` – the list of returned elements

-   `page.offset` – current offset

-   `page.limit` – page size

-   `page.hasMore` – whether more results exist


> **Note:** Future custom rule M004 will validate pagination response structure.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #248](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#248)

### [](#254)Avoid a total result count

In pagination responses you should generally avoid providing a *total result count*, since calculating it is a costly operation that is usually not required by clients.

If a total count is required, it must be clearly documented and justified, and the performance implications must be considered carefully.

> **Note:** Future custom rule M005 will flag total or totalCount fields in responses.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #254](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#254)

## [](#_runtime_security_principles)Runtime Security Principles

### [](#177)Do not expose stack traces

Stack traces contain implementation details that are not part of an API, and on which clients should never rely. Moreover, stack traces can leak sensitive information that partners and third parties are not allowed to receive and may disclose insights about vulnerabilities to attackers.

Error responses must use Problem JSON format without exposing internal details.

> **Note:** This is a runtime behavior principle. Enforcement requires error handling review and runtime monitoring.

**Reference:** [Zalando rule #177](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#177)
