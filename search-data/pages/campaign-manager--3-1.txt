## [](#_business_cases_for_using_campaign_manager)Business cases for using Campaign Manager

1.  **Multi-channel campaign coordination**: Consolidate and manage marketing efforts across various channels (web, email, social media) from a single platform, ensuring consistent messaging and branding.

2.  **Targeted content delivery**: Create and schedule campaigns tailored to specific audience segments, enhancing personalization and engagement.

3.  **Performance tracking**: Monitor campaign effectiveness through integrated analytics, allowing real-time adjustments and improvements.

    In particular, you can send events to your analytics provider using the [campaign ID](../configuration/#_using_campaigns_on_sites) of the component containing your campaigns to get an impression of what users have looked at. Configuration in the Campaign Manager involves adding an analytics tracking ID into the creative component’s metadata. This tracking tag is then the key to performance analytics.

4.  **Resource efficiency**: Streamline content creation and approval workflows, reducing time-to-market for campaigns.
