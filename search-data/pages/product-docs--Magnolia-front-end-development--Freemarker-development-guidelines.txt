# FreeMarker development guidelines

Magnolia gives you the tools to build traditional CMS-driven websites using FreeMarker templates. This approach keeps everything in one place and makes it easy for both developers and authors to collaborate.

FreeMarker development in Magnolia is straightforward and well-suited for server-rendered sites, quick prototyping, and use cases where a full headless setup isn’t required.

Choose FreeMarker-based development if you want:

-   Simplicity and fast iteration with out-of-the-box CMS features

-   Server-rendered pages with Magnolia managing both content and presentation

-   A tight feedback loop between templating and content editing
