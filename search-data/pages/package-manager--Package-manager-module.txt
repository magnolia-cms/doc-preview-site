The Package Manager module installs the Package Manager app allowing users to [configure packages](../configuration/) on author instances and [use the packages](../usage/) on both author and public instances. This page contains details for setting up your environment, from [installation](#_installing_with_maven) to [deployment](#Deployment) and [audit logging](#Audit logging configuration).

> **Note:** When installing any package that overwrites or restructures existing content, schedule a maintenance window for the affected paths. During this window, team members must not edit, publish, move, delete, or run bulk operations on the impacted content. Use a system-wide notification to inform all affected users before and during the window.

> **Caution:** Package manager is incompatible with assets that include binaries stored outside of JCR. This applies to hybrid assets and DAM version 5, version 6, and later.

## [](#_installing_with_maven)Installing with Maven

Maven is the easiest way to install the module. Add the following to your [bundle](../../product-docs/7.0/Developing/Bundles-and-webapps/):

<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.packagemanager</groupId>
  <artifactId>magnolia-package-manager-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.2</version> (1)
</dependency>
```
