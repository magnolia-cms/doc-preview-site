# Creating a backup manually

This page describes how to manually back up the Live environment of a Magnolia cloud-based site.

> **Note:** Magnolia also creates backups automatically (see when data is backed up for further information).

You can create manual backups as often as you want. However, [only the latest one is stored](../#_how_many_backups).

## [](#_create_manual_backup)Create manual backup

1.  In the Site overview page, click **Manage environments** in the Environments section.

2.  Under **Back up and Restore**, click **Back up Content**.

3.  Confirm the actions of the back up operation and click **Back up**.

    ![user interface confirm backup action](../../../_images/cloud/confirm-backup-action.png)

    The backup action is triggered.

4.  Click **OK**.


Cockpit actions

All actions in the Magnolia cockpit are *asynchronous*, so you can click **OK** before the backup is complete.

The action runs in the background and a notification appears once it is complete. The action also appears in the [activity log](../../../Cockpit/Understanding-activity-logs/).
