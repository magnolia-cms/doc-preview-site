# VWO AB Testing module

[Analytics and optimization](../../product-docs/7.0/use-cases/analytics-and-optimization/) [Unbundled: Extension](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/ps/incubator/abtesting-external) Version 1.0.2 [Magnolia 6.3 and 6.2](#6.3@product-docs:ROOT:index.adoc) compatible

The **VWO AB Testing module** integrates Magnolia with the [VWO platform](https://www.vwo.com/), enabling comprehensive and professional A/B and multivariate testing. Instead of creating content variants in Magnolia, the VWO editor is used. This allows testing on any internet-accessible website, including headless applications.

Headless approach?

If you are using a headless approach, the headless website must be integrated with Magnolia to view the status of a related VWO campaign in the Magnolia pages app.

The module pulls URLs from VWO campaigns and matches them to Magnolia, based on your configuration. If a Magnolia page is linked to a VWO campaign, a flag is placed in JCR to ensure that the performance of the user interface remains unaffected.

Linking VWO campaigns to Magnolia content occurs when you open the External AB Testing app and when using a scheduled job. This task also removes VWO campaigns from pages once they have been deleted.

## [](#_get_started)Get started

To get started using the VWO AB Testing module:

1.  [Create a VWO account](create-vwo/) and get the VWO SmartCode.

2.  You’ll need to [Set up the module](developers/) in Magnolia.

3.  Then, you’re able to [use the module](authors/) for AB testing.


## [](#_limitations)Limitations

-   If a certain HTML page is used multiple times in VWO, the link from the VWO app to the Pages app only works for the **first page**.

-   Editing/publishing pages with active VWO tests is not programmatically restricted.

-   Other test types (e.g., Split URL Tests) are currently displayed, but may be filtered in future versions.
