# Content Watch

Content Watch lets you use Smart Chat to monitor external URLs — such as competitor blogs, industry publications, or partner websites — and generate content ideas powered by AI. The generated ideas can be turned into tasks in Orchestrate module automatically, so your content team can act on them right away.

You interact with Content Watch entirely through Smart Chat. There is nothing to install or configure as an author; just open the Smart Chat chat and describe what you need.

## [](#_what_you_can_do)What you can do

Content Watch gives you four capabilities through the Smart Chat chat:

-   **Generate content ideas** — Analyze a URL right now and get content ideas back.

-   **Schedule recurring monitoring** — Set up a watch on a URL so that ideas are generated automatically on a schedule.

-   **List active watches** — See which URLs are currently being monitored.

-   **Cancel a watch** — Stop monitoring a URL you no longer need to track.


| Parameter | How to use it |
| --- | --- |
| **URL** | Include the URL in your message. If you don’t, the Smart Chat will ask for it. |
| **Number of ideas** | Mention a specific number, for example *"give me 6 ideas"* . If you don’t specify, 4 ideas are generated. |
| **Create tasks** | Say *"and create tasks"* or *"just show the ideas, don’t create tasks"* . If you don’t mention it, the Smart Chat will ask. |

## [](#_schedule_recurring_monitoring)Schedule recurring monitoring

Ask Smart Chat to monitor a URL on a recurring schedule. Each time the watch runs, it analyzes the URL and creates tasks with fresh content ideas.

Example prompts

> Watch [https://competitor.com/blog](https://competitor.com/blog) every Monday and generate content ideas.
>
> Monitor [https://industry-news.com/latest](https://industry-news.com/latest) every weekday at 9am.
>
> Schedule content ideas from [https://partner.com/resources](https://partner.com/resources) on the first day of each month.
>
> Track [https://example.com/blog](https://example.com/blog) for new ideas, check it weekly.

### [](#_what_happens_2)What happens

1.  Smart Chat sets up a recurring job that runs on the schedule you described.

2.  Each time the job runs, it fetches the URL, generates content ideas, and creates tasks.

3.  Smart Chat confirms the schedule and gives you a **job name** that you can use later to cancel the watch.


> **Tip:** You don’t need to know cron syntax. Describe the schedule in plain language ("every Monday", "twice a week", "first of each month") and the Smart Chat will translate it for you.

## [](#_list_active_watches)List active watches

Ask Smart Chat to show you all URLs that are currently being monitored.

Example prompts

> What URLs am I monitoring?
>
> Show me my active content watches.
>
> List all scheduled watches.
>
> What’s being monitored right now?

### [](#_what_you_get_back)What you get back

Smart Chat returns a list of active watches, including:

-   The monitored URL

-   The schedule (how often it runs)

-   The job name (needed if you want to cancel it)

-   When it will run next


## [](#_cancel_a_watch)Cancel a watch

Ask Smart Chat to stop monitoring a URL. The Smart Chat needs the **job name** that was returned when the watch was scheduled. If you don’t remember the job name, ask the Smart Chat to list your active watches first.

Example prompts

> Stop watching the competitor blog.
>
> Cancel the content watch for contentWatch-a1b2c3d4.
>
> Remove the scheduled watch on [https://competitor.com/blog](https://competitor.com/blog).
>
> List my watches, then cancel the one for the partner site.

> **Tip:** If you don’t remember the exact job name, ask Smart Chat to list your active watches first, then tell it which one to cancel.

## [](#_tips_for_better_results)Tips for better results

-   **Be specific about the URL.** Include the full URL in your message so the Smart Chat doesn’t have to ask.

-   **Mention whether you want tasks created.** This saves a follow-up question from the Smart Chat.

-   **Use plain language for schedules.** Say *"every Monday at 9am"* rather than trying to write a cron expression.

-   **Ask for a specific number of ideas** if you want more or fewer than the default of 4.

-   **Combine actions.** You can say *"List my watches and cancel the one for example.com"* in a single message.
