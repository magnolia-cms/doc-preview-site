## [](#_usage)Usage

Once installed, the system will display an additional application, open the application and start creating content types. New content types are registered in the resources workspace as yaml files, following the standard configuration here, content types can be published as regular nodes and they will be registered in the public, just the content type, not the app since the content is entered on author. Content types can be deleted if unpublished, and the app and repository will be deleted as well.
