# AI Agent framework

AI Agents are extensible conversational AI assistants that can be integrated into Magnolia CMS. They enable LLM-powered automation and assistance through a chat interface, with support for tool execution, streaming responses, and context-aware operations.

## [](#_overview)Overview

The AI Agent framework provides:

-   **Conversational AI** - Multi-turn conversations with LLMs (currently OpenAI)

-   **Tool execution** - Agents can execute tools to perform actions in Magnolia

-   **Context awareness** - Tools receive user’s current location and selection

-   **Streaming responses** - Real-time SSE (Server-Sent Events) for responsive feedback

-   **Extensibility** - Custom tools, renderers, and agent implementations


### [](#_how_it_works)How it works

1.  User sends a message through the chat interface

2.  The agent processes the message using an LLM (such as OpenAI GPT-4o)

3.  The agent can call tools to perform actions in Magnolia

4.  Results are streamed back to the chat UI in real-time


The agent framework consists of:

-   **Agent definitions** – YAML files defining agents

-   **Tool definitions** – YAML files defining tools used by agents

-   **Frontend components** – React chat interface with custom renderers


Your agent configuration directly enables the features authors see in [Smart Chat](../../authors/ai-chat/):

-   The `name` property becomes the chat interface title

-   `tools` define the actions authors can request

-   `systemPrompt` controls how the AI responds to author requests

-   Tool requirements ensure context-aware assistance


## [](#_getting_started)Getting started

To configure AI agents for authors, complete these steps in order:

1.  [Install](../) and configure the AI Accelerator module.

2.  Configure the OpenAI [provider](../provider-config/openai-config/) and [model](../model-configuration/).

3.  [Create your agent definition](../ai-agent/#agent-definitions).

4.  [Define the required tools and tasks](../ai-agent/#tool-configuration).


> **Note:** Currently only openAiAgent is supported.
