# Sample app

The Sample app is a learning example for developers. It is not a tool for editors but rather a showcase for common app functionality at development level. It shows you how to expose actions to the user as user interface elements (buttons) and how to trigger actions. As a developer you should examine the [Sample app source code](https://gitlab.magnolia-platform.com/pd/platform/ui/-/tree/master/sample-app) and read the comments in the code.
